Îto diffusion
=============

The Îto diffusion model advances computational particles as drifting Brownian walkers

.. math::
   
   \Delta\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{V}\Delta t + \sqrt{2D\Delta t}\mathbf{W}

where :math:`\mathbf{X}` is the spatial position of a particle :math:`\mathbf{V}` is the drift velocity and :math:`D` is the diffusion coefficient *in the continuum limit*.
The vector term :math:`\mathbf{W}` is a Gaussian random field with a mean value of 0 and standard deviation of 1.

.. note::
   
   The code for Îto diffusion is given in :file:`/Source/ItoSolver`.

.. _Chap:ItoSolver:

ItoSolver
---------

The class ``ItoSolver`` encapsulatse the motion of drift-diffusion particles.
This class can advance a set of particles (see :ref:`Chap:ItoParticle`) with the following functionality:

* Move particles using a microscopic drift-diffusion model.
* Compute particle intersection with embedded boundaries and domain edges.
* Deposit particles and other particle types on the mesh.
* Interpolate velocities and diffusion coefficients to the particle positons.
* Manage superparticle splitting and merging.

``ItoSolver`` also defines an enum ``WhichContainer`` for classification of ``ParticleContainer`` data holders for holding particles that live on:

* The embedded boundary (``WhichContainer::EB``).
* On the domain edges/faces (``WhichContainer::Domain``).
* Representing ''source particles'' (``WhichContainer::Source``).
* Particles that live *inside* the EB (``WhichContainer::Covered``).

The particles are available from the solver through the function

.. code-block::

   ParticleContainer<ItoParticle>&
   ItoSolver::getParticles(const WhichContainer a_whichParticles);

For the ``ItoSolver`` the particle velocity is computed as

.. math::

   \mathbf{V} = \mu\left(\mathbf{X}\right)\mathbf{v}\left(\mathbf{X}\right)

where :math:`\mu` is a particle mobility and :math:`\mathbf{v}` is a velocity field defined on the mesh.
Note that both :math:`\mu` and :math:`\mathbf{v}` are defined on the mesh.
The solver can, alternatively, also compute the velocity as

.. math::

   \mathbf{V} = \left(\mu\mathbf{v}\right)\left(\mathbf{X}\right),

i.e. through interpolation of :math:`\mu\mathbf{v}` to the particle position.
Regardless of which method is chosen (see :ref:`Chap:ItoInterpolation`), both :math:`\mu` and :math:`\mathbf{v}` exist on the mesh (stored as ``EBAMRCellData``).

.. _Chap:ItoParticle:

ItoParticle
-----------

The ``ItoParticle`` is used as the underlying particle type for running the Ito drift-diffusion solvers.
It derives from :ref:`Chap:GenericParticle` as follows:

.. code-block:: c++

   class ItoParticle : public GenericParticle<4,2>

and contains the following relevant member functions

.. code-block:: c++

   // Storing for particle weight
   Real&
   ItoParticle::weight();

   // Storage for particle diffusion coefficient
   Real&
   ItoParticle::diffusion();

   // Storage for particle mobility
   Real&
   ItoParticle::mobility();

   // Storage for particle energy
   Real&
   ItoParticle::energy();

   // Storage for particle velocity
   RealVect&
   ItoParticle::velocity();

   // Storage for previous particle position
   RealVect&
   ItoParticle::oldPosition();

All of these functions have corresponding functions with ``const`` qualifiers.

.. _Chap:ItoSpecies:

ItoSpecies
-----------

``ItoSpecies`` is a class for parsing information into ``ItoSolver``.
The constructor for the ``ItoSpecies`` class is

.. code-block:: c++

   ItoSpecies(const std::string a_name, const int a_chargeNumber, const bool a_mobile, const bool a_diffusive);

and this will set the name of the class, the charge, and whether or not the transport kernels use drift and/or diffusion.

.. note::

   ``ItoSpecies`` API is available at `<https://chombo-discharge.github.io/chombo-discharge/doxygen/html/classItoSpecies.html>`_.

Initial data for the ``ItoSolver`` is provided through ``ItoSpecies`` by providing it with a list of initial particles.
``ItoSpecies`` have members that provide/modify the initial particles:

.. code-block:: c++

   class ItoSpecies {
   public:

      List<ItoParticle>&
      getInitialParticles();
      
   protected:

      List<ItoParticle> m_initialParticles;
   };

When ``ItoSolver`` initializes the data in the solver, it transfers the particles from the species and into the solver.
See :ref:`Chap:ParticleOps` for examples on how to draw initial particles and how to partition them when using MPI.

Transport kernel
----------------

The transport kernels for the ``ItoSolver`` will simply consist of particle updates of the following type:

.. code-block:: c++

   Real a_dt;
   List<ItoParticle> particles;
   
   for (ListIterator<ItoParticle>& lit(particles); lit.ok(); ++lit) {
      ItoParticle& p = lit();

      p.oldPosition() = p.position();
      p.position()   += p.velocity() * a_dt + sqrt(2.0*p.diffusion()*a_dt) * this->randomGaussian();
   }

The function ``randomGaussian`` implements a diffusion hopping and returns a 2D/3D dimensional vector with values drawn from a normal distribution with standard width of one and mean value of zero.
The implementation uses the random number generators in :ref:`Chap:Random`.
The user can choose to truncate the normal distribution, see :ref:`Chap:ItoInput`.

Remapping particles
-------------------

To remap, call the ``ItoSolver`` remapping functions as

.. code-block:: c++

   void
   ItoSolver::remap();

This will remap the particles to the correct grid patches.

To remap the other ``ParticleContainer`` data holders (holding e.g. particles that intersected the EB), there's an alternative function

.. code-block:: c++

   void
   ItoSolver::remap(const WhichContainer a_container);

where ``a_container`` is one of the particle containers.

Deposition
----------

To deposit the particle weights onto the grid one can use

.. code-block:: c++

   void
   ItoSolver::depositParticles();

The particles are deposited into the data holder ``m_phi``.
The data can then be fetched with

.. code-block:: c++

   EBAMRCellData&
   ItoSolver::getPhi();
   
To deposit a different particle data holder into ``m_phi`` one can use

.. code-block:: c++

   void
   ItoSolver::depositParticles(const WhichContainer a_container);

This can be used, for example, to deposit the EB particles on the mesh.
More general methods also exist, see the ``ItoSolver`` C++ API `<https://chombo-discharge.github.io/chombo-discharge/doxygen/html/classItoSolver.html>`_.

One can also deposit the following quantities on the mesh:

* Conductivity, which deposits :math:`\mu W`.
* Diffusivity, which deposits :math:`D W`.
* Energy, which deposits :math:`\epsilon W`.    

Here, :math:`W` is the particle weight, :math:`\mu` is the particle mobility, :math:`D` is the particle diffusion coefficient and :math:`\epsilon` is the particle energy.
These functions exist as

.. code-block:: c++

   void
   ItoSolver::depositConductivity(EBAMRCellData& a_phi, ParticleContainer<ItoParticle>& a_particles) const;

   void
   ItoSolver::depositDiffusivity(EBAMRCellData& a_phi, ParticleContainer<ItoParticle>& a_particles) const;

   void
   ItoSolver::depositEnergyDensity(EBAMRCellData& a_phi, ParticleContainer<ItoParticle>& a_particles) const;

.. important::

   The ``ItoSolver`` deposition method is specified in the input script, see :ref:`Chap:ItoInput`.

.. _Chap:ItoInterpolation:

Velocity interpolation
----------------------

Computing the particle velocity is done by first computing the particle mobility and then computing the particle velocity.
For interpolating the mobility to the particle position one will call

.. code-block:: c++

   void
   ItoSolver::interpolateMobilities();

which will compute :math:`\mu\left(\mathbf{X}\right)` using the user-specified deposition/interpolation method for computing the mobility.
The solver can switch between two ways of computing the mobility.
The first is to compute :math:`\mu\left(\mathbf{X}\right)` directly.
The other is to compute the mobility as

.. math::

   \mu = \frac{\left(\mu\left|\mathbf{v}\right|\right)\left(\mathbf{X}\right)}{\left|\mathbf{v}\left(\mathbf{X}\right)\right|}.

When computing the particle velocity as :math:`\mathbf{V} = \mu\left(\mathbf{X}\right)\mathbf{v}\left(\mathbf{X}\right)`, the latter method ensures that :math:`\mathbf{V} = \left(\mu\mathbf{v}\right)\left(\mathbf{X}\right)`.

.. note::

   The user selects between the two mobility interpolation methods in the input script.
   See :ref:`Chap:ItoInput`.

After the mobility has been appropriately set, the velocity can be interpolated from

.. code-block:: c++

   void
   ItoSolver::interpolateVelocities();

The above will compute :math:`v\left(\mathbf{X}\right)` and set the velocity as :math:`\mathbf{V} = \mu\left(\mathbf{X}\right)\mathbf{v}\left(\mathbf{X}\right)`.

.. important::

   The ``ItoSolver`` interpolation method is specified in the input script, see :ref:`Chap:ItoInput`.

Particle intersections
----------------------

It will happen that particles occasionally hit the embedded boundary or leave through the domain sides.
In this case one might want to keep the particles in separate data holders rather than discard them.
``ItoSolver`` supplies the following routine for transferring the particles to the containers that hold the EB and domain particles:

.. code-block:: c++

   void
   ItoSolver::intersectParticles(const EbIntersection a_ebIntersection, const bool a_deleteParticles);

Here, ``EbIntersection`` is a just an enum for putting logic into how the intersection is computed.
Valid options are ``EbIntersection::Bisection`` and ``EbIntersection::Raycast``.
These algorithms are discussed in :ref:`Chap:ParticleEB`.
The flag ``a_deleteParticles`` specifies if the original particles should be deleted when populating the other particle containers.

After calling ``intersectParticles``, the particles that crossed the EB or domain walls are available through the ``getParticles`` routine, see :ref:`Chap:ItoSolver`. 
   

Computing time steps
--------------------

The drift time step routines are implemented such that one restricts the time step such that the fastest particle does not move more than a specified number of grid cells.
This routine is implemented as

.. code-block::

   Real
   ItoSolver::computeAdvectiveDt() const;

which returns a CFL-like condition :math:`\Delta x/\textrm{max}(v_x, v_y, v_z)` on the the various AMR levels and patches.

The signatures for the diffusion time step are similar to the ones for drift:

.. code-block:: c++

   Real
   ItoSolver::computeDiffusiveDt() const;

and this returns another CFL-like condition :math:`\Delta x^2 / (2dD)` for all the particles, where :math:`d` is the spatial dimension.
Note that there is no fundamental limitation to how far the particles can move, unless the user explicitly makes this restriction in the input options, see :ref:`Chap:ItoInput`.

A combination of the advection and diffusion time step routines also exists as

.. code-block::

   Real
   ItoSolver::computeDt() const;

This routine computes the time step

.. math::

   \Delta t = \frac{1}{\frac{\Delta x}{\textrm{max}(v_x, v_y, v_z)} + \frac{\Delta x^2}{2dD}},

Superparticles
--------------

``ItoSolver`` currently handles superparticles through kD-trees, see :ref:`Chap:SuperParticles`, re-initialization, or user-based criteria. 
The function for splitting and merging the particles is in all cases

.. code-block:: c++

   void
   ItoSolver::makeSuperparticles(const WhichContainer a_container, const int a_particlesPerCell);

Calling this function will merge/split the particles.

The default behavior in ``ItoSolver`` is to not merge the particles, but the user can set the merging algorithm through the input script, or supply one externally.
In order to specify the merging algorithm the user must set the ``ItoSolver.merge_algorithm`` to one of the following:

* ``none`` - No particle merging/splitting is performed.
* ``equal_weight_kd`` Use a kD-tree with bounding volume hierarchies to partition and split/merge the particles.
* ``reinitialize`` Re-initialize the particles in each grid cell, ensuring that weights are as uniform as possible.
* ``external`` Use an externally injected particle merging algorithm. In order to use this feature the user must supply one through

  .. code-block:: c++

     // Set a particle merging algorithm
     virtual void
     setParticleMerger(const std::function<void(List<ItoParticle>& a_particles, const CelInfo& a_cellinfo, const int a_numParticles)>);

  where the input function is a function which merges the input particles, possibly also taking into account geometric information in the cell.

.. tip::
   
   ``ItoSolver`` uses the kD-node implementation from :ref:`Chap:SuperParticles` and partitioners for splitting the particles into two subsets with equal weights.

.. _Chap:ItoIO:

.. _Chap:ItoPlot:

Plot files
__________

``ItoSolver`` can output the following variables to plot files:

* :math:`\phi`, i.e. the deposited particle weights (``ItoSolver.plt_vars = phi``)
* :math:`\mathbf{v}`, the advection field (``ItoSolver.plt_vars = vel``).
* :math:`D`, the diffusion coefficient  (``ItoSolver.plt_vars = dco``).

It can also plot the corresponding particle data holders:

* Ito particles (``ItoSolver.plt_vars = part``).
* EB particles  (``ItoSolver.plt_vars = eb_part``).
* Domain particles  (``ItoSolver.plt_vars = domain_part``).
* Source particles  (``ItoSolver.plt_vars = source_part``).

.. _Chap:ItoCheck:  

Checkpoint files
________________

When writing checkpoint files, ``ItoSolver`` can either

* Add the particles to the HDF5 file,
* Checkpoint the corresponding fluid data.

The user specifies this through the input script variable ``ItoSolver.checkpointing``, see :ref:`Chap:ItoInput`.
If checkpointing fluid data then a subsequent restart will generate a new set of particles.

.. warning::

   If writing particle checkpoint files, simulation restarts must also *read* as if the checkpoint file contains particles. 

.. _Chap:ItoInput:

Input options
-------------

I/O
___

Plot variables are specified using ``ItoSolver.plt_vars``, see :ref:`Chap:ItoPlot`).
If adding the various particle container data holders to the plot file, the deposition method for those is specified using ``ItoSolver.plot_deposition``.

If using fluid checkpointing for simulation restarts, the flag ``ItoSolver.ppc_restart`` determines the maximum number of particles that will initialized in each grid cell during a restart. 


Particle-mesh
_____________

To specify the mobility interpolation, use ``ItoSolver.mobility_interp``.
Valid options are ``direct`` and ``velocity``, see :ref:`Chap:ItoInterpolation`.

Deposition and coarse-fine deposition (see :ref:`Chap:ParticleMesh`) is controlled using the flags

* ``ItoSolver.deposition`` for the base deposition scheme.
  Valid options are ``ngp``, ``cic``, and ``tsc``.
* ``ItoSolver.deposition_cf`` for the coarse-fine deposition strategy.
  Valid options are ``interp``, ``halo``, or ``halo_ngp``.

To modify the deposition scheme in cut-cells, one can enforce NGP interpolation and deposition through

* ``ItoSolver.irr_ngp_deposition`` for enforcing NGP deposition. Valid options are ``true`` or ``false``.
* ``ItoSolver.irr_ngp_interp`` for enforcing NGP interpolation. Valid options are ``true`` or ``false``.

.. _Chap:MeshData:

Mesh data
=========

Mesh data structures of the type discussed in :ref:`Chap:SpatialDiscretization` are derived from a class ``EBAMRData<T>`` which holds a ``T`` in every grid patch across the AMR hiearchy.
A requirement on the datatype ``T`` is that it must be linearizable so that it can be communicated across MPI ranks. 
Internally, the data is stored as a ``Vector<RefCountedPtr<LevelData<T>>>``.
Here, the ``Vector`` holds data on each AMR level; the data is allocated with a smart pointer called ``RefCountedPtr`` which points to a ``LevelData`` template structure, see :ref:`Chap:Basics`.
The first entry in the ``Vector`` is base AMR level and finer levels follow later in the ``Vector``.
:numref:`Fig:EBAMRData` shows a sketch of the data layout in a two-level AMR hierarchy. 

.. _Fig:EBAMRData:
.. figure:: /_static/figures/PatchBasedAMR.png
   :width: 60%
   :align: center

   Cartesian patch-based refinement showing two grid levels.
   The finer level consists of two patches (red and blue zones), and these zones each have a ghost cell layer 2 cells wide.
   The data lies on top of a coarse-grid data, i.e., data simultaneously exists on both the fine and the coarse levels. 
   This data type is encapsulated by ``EBAMRData<T>``.

The reason for having class encapsulation of mesh data is due to :ref:`Chap:Realm`, so that we can only keep track on which ``Realm`` the mesh data is defined.
Users will interact with ``EBAMRData<T>`` through application code, or interacting with the core AMR functionality in :ref:`Chap:AmrMesh` (such as computing gradients, interpolating ghost cells etc.).
:ref:`Chap:AmrMesh` has functionality for constructing most ``EBAMRData<T>`` types on a ``Realm``, and ``EBAMRData<T>`` itself it typically not used anywhere elsewhere within ``chombo-discharge``.

A number of explicit template specifications exist and are frequently used.
These are outlined below: 

.. code-block:: c++

   typedef EBAMRData<EBCellFAB>        EBAMRCellData;  // Cell-centered single-phase data
   typedef EBAMRData<EBFluxFAB>        EBAMRFluxData;  // Face-centered data in all coordinate direction
   typedef EBAMRData<EBFaceFAB>        EBAMRFaceData;  // Face-centered in a single coordinate direction
   typedef EBAMRData<BaseIVFAB<Real> > EBAMRIVData;    // Data on irregular data centroids
   typedef EBAMRData<DomainFluxIFFAB>  EBAMRIFData;    // Data on domain phases
   typedef EBAMRData<BaseFab<bool> >   EBAMRBool;      // For holding bool at every cell

   typedef EBAMRData<MFCellFAB>        MFAMRCellData;  // Cell-centered multifluid data
   typedef EBAMRData<MFFluxFAB>        MFAMRFluxData;  // Face-centered multifluid data
   typedef EBAMRData<MFBaseIVFAB>      MFAMRIVData;    // Irregular face multifluid data   


For example, ``EBAMRCellData`` is a ``Vector<RefCountedPtr<LevelData<EBCellFAB> > >``, describing cell-centered data across the entire AMR hierarchy.
There are many more data structures in place, but the above data structures are the most commonly used ones.
Here, ``EBAMRFluxData`` is precisely like ``EBAMRCellData``, except that the data is stored on *cell faces* rather than cell centers.
Likewise, ``EBAMRIVData`` is a data holder that holds data on each EB centroid (or boundary centroid) across the entire AMR hierachy.
In the same way, ``EBAMRIFData`` holds data on each face of all cut-cells in the hierarchy. 

Allocating mesh data
--------------------

To allocate data over a particular ``Realm``, the user will interact with :ref:`Chap:AmrMesh`:

.. code-block:: c++

   const int numComps = 1;
   EBAMRCellData myData;
   m_amr->allocate(myData, "myRealm", phase::gas, numComps);

Here, ``numCOmps`` determine the number of data components.
Note that it *does* matter on which ``Realm`` and on which ``phase`` the data is defined.
See :ref:`Chap:Realm` for details.

The user *can* specify a number of ghost cells for his/hers application code directly in the ``AmrMesh::allocate`` routine, like so:

.. code-block:: c++

   int numComps = 1;
   EBAMRCellData myData;
   m_amr->allocate(myData, "myRealm", phase::gas, numComps, 5*IntVect::Unit);

If the user does not specify the number of ghost cells when calling ``AmrMesh::allocate``, :ref:`Chap:AmrMesh` will use the default number of ghost cells specified in the input file.

.. _Chap:MeshIteration:

Iterating over the AMR hierarchy
--------------------------------

To iterate over data in an AMR hierarchy, you will first iterate over levels and then the patches on each level:

.. code-block:: c++

   for (int lvl = 0; lvl < myData.size(); lvl++){
      LevelData<EBCellFAB>& levelData = *myData[lvl];

      const DisjointBoxLayout& levelGrids = levelData.disjointBoxLayout();
      
      for (DataIterator dit = levelGrids.dataIterator(); dit.ok(); ++dit){
         EBCellFAB& patchData = levelData[dit()];
      }
   }

Throughout ``chombo-discharge`` it will be common to see the above implemented explicitly as a loop that supports OpenMP:

.. code-block::

   for (int lvl = 0; lvl < myData.size(); lvl++){
      LevelData<EBCellFAB>& levelData = *myData[lvl];

      const DisjointBoxLayout& levelGrids = levelData.disjointBoxLayout();
      const DataIterator& dataIterator    = levelGrids.dataIterator();

      const int numBoxes = dataIterator.size();

   #pragma omp parallel for schedule(runtime)
      for (int currentBox = 0; currentBox < numBoxes; currentBox++) {
         const DataIndex& dataIndex = dataIterator[currentBox];
	 
         EBCellFAB& patchData = levelData[dataIndex];
      }
   }

Iterating over cells
--------------------

For single-valued data, ``chombo-discharge`` uses standard loops (in column-major order) for iterating over data.
For example, the standard loops for iterating over cell-centered data are

.. code-block:: c++

   namespace BoxLoops {
   
      template <typename Functor>
      ALWAYS_INLINE void
      loop(const Box& a_computeBox, Functor&& kernel, const IntVect& a_stride = IntVect::Unit);

      template <typename Functor>
      ALWAYS_INLINE void
      loop(VoFIterator& a_iter, Functor&& a_kernel);
   }

Here, the ``Functor`` argument is a C++ lambda or ``std::function`` which takes a grid cell as a single argument.
For the first loop, we iterate over all grid cells in ``a_computeBox``.
Iterating over the cut-cells in a patch data holder (like the ``EBCellFAB``) can be done with a ``VoFIterator``, which can iterate through cells on an ``EBCellFAB`` that are not covered by the geometry.
For example:

.. code-block:: c++

   const int component = 0;

   for (int lvl = 0; lvl < myData.size(); lvl++){
      LevelData<EBCellFAB>& levelData = *myData[lvl];

      const DisjointBoxLayout& levelGrids = levelData.disjointBoxLayout();
      
      for (DataIterator dit = levelGrids.dataIterator(); dit.ok(); ++dit){
         EBCellFAB& patchData       = levelData[dit()];
	 BaseFab<Real>& regularData = patchData.getSingleValuedFab();

	 auto regularKernel = [&](const IntVect& iv) -> void {
	    regularData(iv, component) = 1.0;
	 };

	 auto irregularKernel = [&](const VolIndex& vof) -> void {
	    patchData(vof, component = 1.0;
	 };

	 // Kernel regions (defined by user)
	 Box computeBox = ...
	 VoFIterator vofit = ...

	 BoxLoops::loop(computeBox, regularKernel);
	 BoxLoops::loop(vofit, irregularKernel);	 
      }
   }

There are loops available for other types of data (e.g., face-centered data), see the `BoxLoop documentation <https://chombo-discharge.github.io/chombo-discharge/doxygen/html/CD__BoxLoops_8H.html>`_.

.. _Chap:Coarsening:

Coarsening data
---------------

Coarsening of data implies replacing the coarse-grid data that lies underneath a fine grid by some average of the fine-grid data.
We currently support the following coarsening algorithms:

* Arithmetic coarsening, in which the coarse-grid value is simply the average of the fine-grid values.
* Conservative coarsening, in which the coarse-grid value is the conservative average of the fine-grid values.
  This implies that the total mass on the coarse-grid cell is identical to the total mass in the fine-grid cells from which one coarsened. 
* Harmonic, in which the coarse-grid value is the harmonic average of the fine-grid cell values.

These functions are available for both cell-centered data, cut-cell data, and face-centered data.
Multiply signatures for this functionality exists, see the code-block below.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../Source/AmrMesh/CD_AmrMesh.H
   :lines: 697-704, 729-737, 764-776
   :language: c++
   :dedent: 2
	    
See the `AmrMesh API <https://chombo-discharge.github.io/chombo-discharge/doxygen/html/classAmrMesh.html>`_ for further details. 

.. _Chap:GhostCells:

Filling ghost cells
-------------------

Filling ghost cells is done using the ``interpGhost(...)`` functions in :ref:`Chap:AmrMesh`.
This process adheres to the following rules:

#. Within a grid level, cells are always filled from neighboring grid patches without interpolation.
#. Around the halo zone (see :numref:`Fig:EBAMRData`), ghost cells are filled using slope-limited interpolation *from the coarse grid only*.
   Currently, this slope is calculated with a minmod limiter, although support for superbee, piecewise constant, and van Leer limiters are also implemented.

The signatures for updating the ghost cells are:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../Source/AmrMesh/CD_AmrMesh.H
   :lines: 1308-1315
   :language: c++
   :dedent: 2

As one alternative, one can update ghost cells on a single grid level:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../Source/AmrMesh/CD_AmrMesh.H
   :lines: 1317-1330
   :language: c++
   :dedent: 2


Strictly speaking it is also possible to update ghost cells using the multigrid interpolator, but this will only fill a single layer of ghost cells around the halo zone (except near the cut-cells where additional cells are filled).

.. _Chap:CoarseGridInterpolation:

Interpolating from the coarse grid
----------------------------------

Coarse-grid interpolation occurs, e.g., when the AMR hierarchy changes.
If one needs data on a grid level where no data already exists, it is possible to fill this data by interpolating from the coarse grid to a finer one.

.. important::

   This type of interpolation is distinctly different from the ghost cell interpolation, as it affects data across the whole grid patch.

The interpolation function that fill fine-grid data from a coarse grid has the following signature:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../Source/AmrMesh/CD_AmrMesh.H
   :lines: 1399-1418
   :language: c++
   :dedent: 2

Here, the user must supply both the old data and the new data, as well as on which grid levels the interpolation will take place.
The final argument ``a_type`` is the interpolation type.
We currently support the following interpolation methods:

* ``Type::PWC``, which is piecewise-constant interpolation where the fine-cell data is filled with the coarse-cell values.
* ``Type::ConservativePWC``, which is a piecewise-constant interpolation that is also conservative (i.e., volume-weighted).
* ``Type::ConservativeMinMod``, which is a conservative interpolation method that uses the minmod limiter.
* ``Type::ConservativeMonotonizedCentral``, which is a conservative interpolation method that uses the van Leer limiter. 
* ``Type::Superbee``, which is a conservative interpolation method that uses the superbeed limiter. 
  
Note that there is "correct" interpolation method, but we note that we typically use a conservative minmod limiter in ``chombo-discharge``.

.. _Chap:Gradients:

Computing gradients
-------------------

In ``chombo-discharge``, gradients are computed using a standard second-order stencil based on finite differences.
This is true everywhere except near the EB where the coarse-side stencil will avoid using the coarsened data beneath the fine level.
This is shown in :numref:`Fig:EBGradient` which shows the typical 5-point stencil in regular grid regions, and also a much larger and more complex stencil.

In :numref:`Fig:EBGradient` we have shown two regular 5-point stencils (red and green).
The coarse stencil (red) reaches underneath the fine level and uses the data defined by coarsening of the fine-level data.
The coarsened data in this case is just a conservative average of the fine-level data.
Likewise, the green stencil reaches over the refinement boundary and into one of the ghost cells on the coarse level.

.. note::

   It is up to the user to ensure that ghost cells are filled prior to computing the gradient.
   This can be done either using multigrid interpolation (see :ref:`Chap:MultigridInterpolation`), or standard interpolation (see :ref:`Chap:GhostCells`).

:numref:`Fig:EBGradient` also shows a much larger stencil (blue stencil) on the coarse side of the refinement interface.
The larger stencil is necessary because computing the :math:`y` component of the gradient using a regular 5-point stencil would have the stencil reach underneath the fine level and into coarse data that is also irregular data.
Since there is no unique way (that we know of) for coarsening the cut-cell fine-level data onto the coarse cut-cell without introducing spurious artifacts into the gradient, we reconstruct the gradient using a least squares procedure that entirely avoids using coarsened data.
In this case we fetch a sufficiently large neighborhood of cells for computing a least squares minimization of a local solution reconstruction in the neighborhood of the coarse cell.
In order to avoid fetching potentially badly coarsened data, this neighborhood of cells only uses *valid* grid cells, i.e., the stencil does not reach underneath the fine level at all.
Once this neighborhood of cells is obtained, we compute the gradient using the procedure in :ref:`Chap:LeastSquares`. 

.. _Fig:EBGradient:
.. figure:: /_static/figures/EBGradient.png
   :width: 50%
   :align: center

   Example of stencils for computing gradients near embedded boundaries.
   The red stencil shows a regular 5-point stencil for computing the gradient on the coarse side of the refinement boundary; it reaches into the coarsened data beneath the fine level.
   The green stencil shows a similar 5-point stencil on the fine side of the refinement boundary; the stencil reaches over the refinement boundary and into one ghost cell.
   The blue stencils shows a much more complex stencil which is computed using a least squares reconstruction procedure. 

To compute gradients of a scalar, one can simply call ``AmrMesh::computeGradient(...)`` functions:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../Source/AmrMesh/CD_AmrMesh.H
   :lines: 444-457
   :language: c++
   :dedent: 2		    

We reiterate that ghost cells must be updated *before* calling this routine.
See :ref:`Chap:AmrMesh` or refer to the `AmrMesh API <https://chombo-discharge.github.io/chombo-discharge/doxygen/html/classAmrMesh.html>`_ for further details.

.. _Chap:CopyingData:

Copying data
------------

To copy data between data holders, one may use the ``AmrMesh<T>::copyData(...)`` function *or* ``DataOps::copy`` (see :ref:`Chap:DataOps`).

The simplest way of copying data between data holders is via ``DataOps::copy``, which does a *local-only* direct copy that also includes ghost cells.
This version requires that the source and destination data holders are defined on the same realm, and does not invoke MPI calls.

A more general version is supplied by :ref:`Chap:AmrMesh`, and has the following structure:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../Source/AmrMesh/CD_AmrMesh.H
   :lines: 97-115
   :language: c++
   :dedent: 2

In the above code, ``a_dst`` and ``a_src`` are the destination and source data holders for the copy.
These need not be defined on the same :ref:`Chap:Realm`.
Similarly, the ``a_dstComps`` and ``a_srcComps`` indicate the source and destination variables to be copied, which must have the same size.
The final two arguments indicate which regions will be copied from.
These are enums that are either ``CopyStrategy::Valid`` or ``CopyStrategy::ValidGhost``, and indicates whether or not we will perform the copy only into *valid* cells (``CopyStrategy::Valid``) or also into the ghost cells (``CopyStrategy::ValidGhost``).

.. _Chap:DataOps:

DataOps
-------

We have prototyped functions for many common data operations in a static class ``DataOps``.

.. tip::
   
   For the full ``DataOps`` API, see the `DataOps documentation <https://chombo-discharge.github.io/chombo-discharge/doxygen/html/classDataOps.html>`_.
   
``DataOps`` contains numerous functions for operating on various template specializations of ``EBAMRData<T>`` (see :ref:`Chap:MeshData`).
For example, ``DataOps`` contains functions for scaling data, incrementing data, averaging cell-centered data onto faces, and many more.

.. important::

   ``DataOps`` is designed to operate only within a single realm.
   This means that *all* arguments into the ``DataOps`` functions *must* be defined on the same realm.

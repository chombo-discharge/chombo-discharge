   **This is an alpha release. Development is still in progress, and various bugs may be present. User interfaces can and will change.**

Welcome to ``chombo-discharge``'s user documentation
****************************************************
	      
``chombo-discharge`` is a modular and scalable research code for Cartesian two- and three-dimensional simulations of low-temperature plasmas in complex geometries.
The code is hosted at `GitHub <https://github.com/chombo-discharge/chombo-discharge>`_ together with the source files for this documentation.

``chombo-discharge`` supports

* Fully written in C++.
* Support for complex geometries.
* Scalar advection-diffusion-reaction processes.
* Electrostatics with support for electrodes and dielectrics.
* Radiative transport as a diffusion or Monte Carlo process.
* Particle-mesh operations (like Particle-In-Cell)
* Parallel I/O with HDF5.
* Dual-grid simulations with individual load balancing of fluid and particles.
* Various multi-physics interfaces that use the above solvers.
* Various time integration schemes.  

.. * ÃŽto particle models for microscopic drift-diffusion-reaction processes.  

Numerical solvers are designed to run either on their own, or as a part of a larger application. 

For scalability, ``chombo-discharge`` is built on top of `Chombo 3 <https://commons.lbl.gov/display/chombo/Chombo+-+Software+for+Adaptive+Solutions+of+Partial+Differential+Equations>`_, and therefore additionally features

* Cut-cell representation of multi-material geometries.
* Patch based adaptive mesh refinement.
* Weak and strong scalability to thousands of computer cores.

Our goal is that users will be able to use ``chombo-discharge`` without modifying the underlying solvers.
There are interfaces for describing e.g. the plasma physics, boundary conditions, mesh refinement, etc.
As ``chombo-discharge`` evolves, so will these interfaces.
We aim for (but cannot guarantee) backward compatibility such that existing ``chombo-discharge`` models can be run on future versions of ``chombo-discharge``.

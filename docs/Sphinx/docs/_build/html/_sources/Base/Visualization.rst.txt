Visualization
=============

``chombo-discharge`` output files are written to HDF5 files in the format ``<simulation_name>.step#.dimension.hdf5`` and the files will be written to the directory specified by :ref:`Chap:driver` runtime parameters.
Currently, we have only used `VisIt <https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/>`_ for visualizing the plot files.

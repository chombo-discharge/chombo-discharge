abstract = {This paper concerns a class of deferred correction methods recently developed for initial value ordinary differential equations; such methods are based on a Picard integral form of the correction equation. These methods divide a given timestep [ t n , t n +1 ] into substeps, and use function values computed at these substeps to approximate the Picard integral by means of a numerical quadrature. The main purpose of this paper is to present a detailed analysis of the implications of the location of quadrature nodes on the accuracy and stability of the overall method. Comparisons between Gauss-Legendre, Gauss-Lobatto, Gauss-Radau, and uniformly spaced points are presented. Also, for a given set of quadrature nodes, quadrature rules may be formulated that include or exclude function values computed at the left-hand endpoint t n . Quadrature rules that do not depend on the left-hand endpoint (which are referred to as right-hand quadrature rules) are shown to lead to L ($\alpha$)-stable implicit methods with $\alpha$≈$\pi$/2. The semi-implicit analog of this property is also discussed. Numerical results suggest that the use of uniform quadrature nodes, as opposed to nodes based on Gaussian quadratures, does not significantly affect the stability or accuracy of these methods for orders less than ten. In contrast, a study of the reduction of order for stiff equations shows that when uniform quadrature nodes are used in conjunction with a right-hand quadrature rule, the form and extent of order-reduction changes considerably. Specifically, a reduction of order to is observed for uniform nodes as opposed to for non-uniform nodes, where $\Delta$ t denotes the time step and $\epsilon$ a stiffness parameter such that $\epsilon$→0 corresponds to the problem becoming increasingly stiff.},

abstract = {A packed bed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) is widely used for plasma catalysis applications, but the exact plasma characteristics in between the packing beads are far from understood. Therefore, we study here these plasma characteristics by means of fluid modelling and experimental observations using ICCD imaging, for packing materials with different dielectric constants. Our study reveals that a packed bed DBD reactor in dry air at atmospheric pressure may show three types of discharges, i.e. positive restrikes, filamentary microdischarges, which can also be localized between two packing beads, and surface discharges (so-called surface ionization waves). Restrikes between the dielectric surfaces result in the formation of filamentary microdischarges, while surface charging creates electric field components parallel to the dielectric surfaces, leading to the formation of surface discharges. A transition in discharge mode occurs from surface discharges to local filamentary discharges between the packing beads when the dielectric constant of the packing rises from 5 to 1000. This may have implications for the efficiency of plasma catalytic gas treatment, because the catalyst activation may be limited by constraining the discharge to the contact points of the beads. The production of reactive species occurs most in the positive restrikes, the surface discharges and the local microdischarges in between the beads, and is less significant in the longer filamentary microdischarges. The faster streamer propagation and discharge development with higher dielectric constant of the packing beads leads to a faster production of reactive species. This study is of great interest for plasma catalysis, where packing beads with different dielectric constants are often used as supports for the catalytic materials. It allows us to better understand how different packing materials can influence the performance of packed bed plasma reactors for environmental applications.},

They evolve in homogeneous electric fields or emerge from needle electrodes with voltages of 10 to 20 kV. The streamer velocity at given streamer length depends only weakly on the initial ionization seed, except in the case of negative streamers in homogeneous fields. We characterize the streamers by length, head radius, head charge and field enhancement. We show that the velocity of positive streamers is mainly determined by their radius and in quantitative agreement with recent experimental results both for radius and velocity. The velocity of negative streamers is dominated by electron drift in the enhanced field; in the low local fields of the present simulations, it is little influenced by photo-ionization. Though negative streamer fronts always move at least with the electron drift velocity in the local field, this drift motion broadens the streamer head, decreases the field enhancement and ultimately leads to slower propagation or even extinction of the negative streamer.},

abstract = {Streamers are the first stage of sparks and lightning; they grow due to a strongly enhanced electric field at their tips; this field is created by a thin curved space charge layer. These multiple scales are already challenging when the electrons are approximated by densities. However, electron density fluctuations in the leading edge of the front and non-thermal stretched tails of the electron energy distribution (as a cause of X-ray emissions) require a particle model to follow the electron motion. But present computers cannot deal with all electrons in a fully developed streamer. Therefore, super-particle have to be introduced, which leads to wrong statistics and numerical artifacts. The method of choice is a hybrid computation in space where individual electrons are followed in the region of high electric field and low density while the bulk of the electrons is approximated by densities (or fluids). We here develop the hybrid coupling for planar fronts. First, to obtain a consistent flux at the interface between particle and fluid model in the hybrid computation, the widely used classical fluid model is replaced by an extended fluid model. Then the coupling algorithm and the numerical implementation of the spatially hybrid model are presented in detail, in particular, the position of the model interface and the construction of the buffer region. The method carries generic features of pulled fronts that can be applied to similar problems like large deviations in the leading edge of population fronts, etc.},

However, the maximum electric field in thunderstorms measured by balloons is ∼6–9 kV{\textperiodcentered}cm−1{\textperiodcentered}atm−1. In present work, to achieve the electric field amplification required for streamer initiation, a system of two approaching spherical hydrometeors is investigated. Streamer initiation is determined from a Meek number, describing electron multiplication in fields above Ek. We have found the relationships between radii of particles for successful streamer initiation in the gap between these two particles and also on the outside periphery of the two particle system when the particles are connected by a discharge channel. Furthermore, we estimated the frequency of streamer initiation using three realistic hydrometeor size model distributions available in the literature and found that the scenario of streamer initiation on the outside periphery is only possible for relatively high electric fields ≥0.5Ek at altitudes of 3 and 6 km.},

abstract = {Numerical fluid models are widely used in gas discharge physics. A typical discharge model comprises continuity equations and drift–diffusion equations for reactive particle species, a balance equation for the electron energy, and Poisson's equation for the electric field. When this system of equations is integrated numerically with respect to time, the explicit evaluation of coupled quantities necessitates strong time step restrictions, resulting in an enormous slowdown of the calculation. The strongest time step restriction arises from an explicit treatment of the coupling between the charged particle transport and the space charge field. In order to circumvent this constraint several implicit and semi-implicit techniques have been developed. When one uses these techniques, however, the explicit handling of the dependence of electron energy source term on the electron mean energy becomes limiting for the time step. In this work we present a technique for the implicit treatment of the electron energy source term, based on linearization with respect to the electron mean energy. This approach makes it possible to increase the time step by several orders of magnitude, thus giving a tremendous speedup of the calculation. Test results are provided for some typical cases, covering a wide range of numerical conditions.},

The streamers propagate in combustible fuel-air mixtures at high pressures representative of internal combustion engine conditions. The study was performed using a self-consistent, two-temperature plasma model with finite-rate plasma chemical kinetics. Positive high voltage pulses of order tens of kV and duration of tens of nanoseconds were applied to the powered inner cylindrical electrode which resulted in the formation and propagation of a cathode-directed streamer. The resulting spatial and temporal production of active radical species such as O, H, and singlet delta oxygen is quantified and compared for lean and stoichiometric fuel-air mixtures. For the coaxial electrode geometry, the discharge is characterized by a primary streamer that bridges the inter-electrode gap and a secondary streamer that develops in the wake of the primary streamer. Most of the radicals are produced in the secondary streamer. For the corona geometry, only the primary streamer is observed and the radicals are produced throughout the length of the primary streamer column. The stoichiometry of the mixture was observed to have a relatively small effect on both the plasma discharge structure and the resulting yield of radical species. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {In most models of reacting gas dynamics, the characteristic time scales of chemical reactions are much shorter than the hydrodynamic and diffusive time scales, rendering the reaction part of the model equations stiff. Moreover, non-linear forcings may introduce into the solutions sharp gradients or shocks, the robust behavior and correct propagation of which require the use of specialized spatial discretization procedures. This study presents high-order conservative methods for the temporal integration of model equations of reacting flows. By means of a method of lines discretization on the flux difference form of the equations, these methods compute approximations to the cell-averaged or finite-volume solution. The temporal discretization is based on a multi-implicit generalization of spectral deferred correction methods. The advection term is integrated explicitly, and the diffusion and reaction terms are treated implicitly but independently, with the splitting errors reduced via the spectral deferred correction procedure. To reduce computational cost, different time steps may be used to integrate processes with widely-differing time scales. Numerical results show that the conservative nature of the methods allows a robust representation of discontinuities and sharp gradients; the results also demonstrate the expected convergence rates for the methods of orders three, four, and five for smooth problems. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The approach results in algorithms of essentially arbitrary order accuracy for both non-stiff and stiff problems; their performance is illustrated with several numerical examples. For non-stiff problems, the stability behavior of the obtained explicit schemes is very satisfactory and algorithms with orders between 8 and 20 should be competitive with the best existing ones. In our preliminary experiments with stiff problems, a simple adaptive implementation of the method demonstrates performance comparable to that of a state-of-the-art extrapolation code (at least, at moderate to high precision).

The present knowledge, based on a widely-accepted concept of critical or stability field introduced half a century ago, indicates the existence of a unique minimum electric field in which streamers could propagate stably with constant radius and velocity. In this work, we present a new understanding indicating that growing, decaying, and stable propagation of streamers is controlled not solely by the external field but also by the physical dimensions of streamers. Stable propagation is demonstrated to be achievable in a wide range of electric fields, with a lower limit of ∼5 kV cm−1 for positive streamers and ∼10 kV cm−1 for negative streamers in air at atmospheric pressure, up to the breakdown field ∼28.7 kV cm−1. In these field ranges, the streamer radius required for stable propagation is inversely proportional to the external field, with larger and smaller initial radii, respectively, leading to growing and decaying streamers. The new mechanism suggests possible ways to flexibly control the streamer parameters in applications, such as changing the size and potential of the point electrode to obtain the required initial streamer dimensions for the desired propagation pattern.},

@article{Johansen1998,
abstract = {We present a numerical method for solving Poisson's equation, with variable coefficients and Dirichlet boundary conditions, on two-dimensional regions. The approach uses a finite-volume discretization, which embeds the domain in a regular Cartesian grid. We treat the solution as a cell-centered quantity, even when those centers are outside the domain. Cells that contain a portion of the domain boundary use conservative differencing of second-order accurate fluxes on each cell volume. The calculation of the boundary flux ensures that the conditioning of the matrix is relatively unaffected by small cell volumes. This allows us to use multigrid iterations with a simple point relaxation strategy. We have combined this with an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) procedure. We provide evidence that the algorithm is second-order accurate on various exact solutions and compare the adaptive and nonadaptive calculations.},

abstract = {Abstract Interacting streamers are commonly found in natural plasma discharges, such as lightning, jets and sprites, but are poorly understood at present. In this paper, we report a three-dimensional modeling study of two interacting streamers simultaneously initiated from identical plasma columns in a uniform ambient field. Simulation results show that the streamers no longer propagate in the direction of the ambient field due to strong repulsion between them. The results also show that the peak field in the streamer head determines the direction of streamer propagation, and that the two streamers propagate in separate directions. We further conjecture that they will be unlikely to merge later on. Finally, the interacting streamers still grow exponentially, with a growth rate similar to an isolated streamer under the same condition.},

@article{Charest2012,
abstract = {The discrete ordinates method (DOM) and finite-volume method (FVM) are used extensively to solve the radiative transfer equation (RTE) in furnaces and combusting mixtures due to their balance between numerical efficiency and accuracy. These methods produce a system of coupled partial differential equations which are typically solved using space-marching techniques since they converge rapidly for constant coefficient spatial discretization schemes and non-scattering media. However, space-marching methods lose their effectiveness when applied to scattering media because the intensities in different directions become tightly coupled. When these methods are used in combination with high-resolution limited total-variation-diminishing (TVD) schemes, the additional non-linearities introduced by the flux limiting process can result in excessive iterations for most cases or even convergence failure for scattering media. Space-marching techniques may also not be quite as well-suited for the solution of problems involving complex three-dimensional geometries and/or for use in highly-scalable parallel algorithms. A novel pseudo-time marching algorithm is therefore proposed herein to solve the DOM or FVM equations on multi-block body-fitted meshes using a highly scalable parallel-implicit solution approach in conjunction with high-resolution TVD spatial discretization. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is also employed to properly capture disparate solution scales with a reduced number of grid points. The scheme is assessed in terms of discontinuity-capturing capabilities, spatial and angular solution accuracy, scalability, and serial performance through comparisons to other commonly employed solution techniques. The proposed algorithm is shown to possess excellent parallel scaling characteristics and can be readily applied to problems involving complex geometries. In particular, greater than 85{\%} parallel efficiency is demonstrated for a strong scaling problem on up to 256 processors. Furthermore, a speedup of a factor of at least two was observed over a standard space-marching algorithm using a limited scheme for optically thick scattering media. Although the time-marching approach is approximately four times slower for absorbing media, it vastly outperforms standard solvers when parallel speedup is taken into account. The latter is particularly true for geometrically complex computational domains.},

abstract = {We recently have presented first physical predictions of a spatially hybrid model that follows the evolution of a negative streamer discharge in full three spatial dimensions; our spatially hybrid model couples a particle model in the high field region ahead of the streamer with a fluid model in the streamer interior where electron densities are high and fields are low. Therefore the model is computationally efficient, while it also follows the dynamics of single electrons including their possible run-away. Here we describe the technical details of our computations, and present the next step in a systematic development of the simulation code. First, new sets of transport coefficients and reaction rates are obtained from particle swarm simulations in air, nitrogen, oxygen and argon. These coefficients are implemented in an extended fluid model to make the fluid approximation as consistent as possible with the particle model, and to avoid discontinuities at the interface between fluid and particle regions. Then two splitting methods are introduced and compared for the location and motion of the fluid-particle-interface in three spatial dimensions. Finally, we present first results of the 3D spatially hybrid model for a negative streamer in air. Future applications of the hybrid model lie in effects of electron density fluctuations on inception, propagation and branching of streamers, and in accurate calculations of electron energies at and of electron run-away from the streamer head. The last is relevant for hard radiation from streamer-leader systems and possibly for Terrestrial Gamma-Ray Flashes.},

Simulations are performed with a 3D PIC-MCC (particle-in-cell, Monte Carlo collision) model with adaptive mesh refinement for the field solver. This model, whose source code is available online, is described in the first part of the paper. Then we present simulation results in a needle-to-plane geometry, using different nitrogen/oxygen mixtures at atmospheric pressure. In these mixtures non-local photoionization is important for the discharge growth. The typical length scale for this process depends on the oxygen concentration. With 0.2{\%} oxygen the discharges grow quite irregularly, due to the limited supply of free electrons around them. With 2{\%} or more oxygen the development is much smoother. An almost spherical ionized region can form around the electrode tip, which increases in size with the electrode voltage. Eventually this inception cloud destabilizes into streamer channels. In our simulations, discharge velocities are almost independent of the oxygen concentration. We discuss the physical mechanisms behind these phenomena and compare our simulations with experimental observations.},

abstract = {The paper presents the results of temporally and spatially resolved electric field measurements in a nanosecond pulse discharge in atmospheric air, sustained between a razor edge high- voltage electrode and a plane grounded electrode covered by a thin dielectric plate. The electric field is measured by picosecond four-wave mixing in a collinear phase-matching geometry, with time resolution of approximately 2 ns, using an absolute calibration provided by measurements of a known electrostatic electric field. The results demonstrate electric field offset on the discharge center plane before the discharge pulse due to surface charge accumulation on the dielectric from the weaker, opposite polarity pre-pulse. During the discharge pulse, the electric field follows the applied voltage until ‘forward' breakdown occurs, after which the field in the plasma is significantly reduced due to charge separation. When the applied voltage is reduced, the field in the plasma reverses direction and increases again, until the weak ‘reverse' breakdown occurs, producing a secondary transient reduction in the electric field. After the pulse, the field is gradually reduced on a microsecond time scale, likely due to residual surface charge neutralization by transport of opposite polarity charges from the plasma. Spatially resolved electric field measurements show that the discharge develops as a surface ionization wave. Significant surface charge accumulation on the dielectric surface is detected near the end of the discharge pulse. Spatially resolved measurements of electric field vector components demonstrate that the vertical electric field in the surface ionization wave peaks ahead of the horizontal electric field. Behind the wave, the vertical field remains low, near the detection limit, while the horizontal field is gradually reduced to near the detection limit at the discharge center plane. These results are consistent with time-resolved measurements of electric field components, which also indicate that vertical electric field reverses direction after the ionization wave. Keywords:},

abstract = {A packed bed dielectric barrier discharge plasma reactor is computationally studied with a fluid model. Two different complementary axisymmetric 2D geometries are used to mimic the intrinsic 3D problem. It is found that a packing enhances the electric field strength and electron temperature at the contact points of the dielectric material due to polarization of the beads by the applied potential. As a result, these contact points prove to be of direct importance to initiate the plasma. At low applied potential, the discharge stays at the contact points, and shows the properties of a Townsend discharge. When a high enough potential is applied, the plasma will be able to travel through the gaps in between the beads from wall to wall, forming a kind of glow discharge. Therefore, the inclusion of a so-called ‘channel of voids' is indispensable in any type of packed bed modelling.},

abstract = {The high order fluid model developed in the preceding paper is employed here to study the propagation of negative planar streamer fronts in pure nitrogen. The model consists of the balance equations for electron density, average electron velocity, average electron energy and average electron energy flux. These balance equations have been obtained as velocity moments of Boltzmann's equation and are here coupled to the Poisson equation for the space charge electric field. Here the results of simulations with the high order model, with a PIC/MC (Particle in cell/Monte Carlo) model and with the first order fluid model based on the hydrodynamic drift-diffusion approximation are presented and compared. The comparison with the MC model clearly validates our high order fluid model, thus supporting its correct theoretical derivation and numerical implementation. The results of the first order fluid model with local field approximation, as usually used for streamer discharges, show considerable deviations. Furthermore, we study the inaccuracies of simulation results caused by an inconsistent implementation of transport data into our high order fluid model. We also demonstrate the importance of the energy flux term in the high order model by comparing with results where this term is neglected. Finally, results with an approximation for the high order tensor in the energy flux equation is found to agree well with the PIC/MC results for reduced electric fields up to 1000 Townsend, as considered in this work.},

@article{Bourlioux2003,
abstract = {Models for reacting flow are typically based on advection-diffusion-reaction (A-D-R) partial differential equations. Many practical cases correspond to situations where the relevant time scales associated with each of the three sub-processes can be widely different, leading to disparate time-step requirements for robust and accurate time-integration. in particular, interesting regimes in combustion correspond to systems in which diffusion and reaction are much faster processes than advection. The numerical strategy introduced in this paper is a general procedure to account for this time-scale disparity. The proposed methods are high-order multi-implicit generalizations of spectral deferred correction methods (MISDC methods), constructed for the temporal integration of A-D-R equations. Spectral deferred correction methods compute a high-order approximation to the solution of a differential equation by using a simple, low-order numerical method to solve a series of correction equations, each of which increases the order of accuracy of the approximation. The key feature of MISDC methods is their flexibility in handling several sub-processes implicitly but independently, while avoiding the splitting errors present in traditional operator-splitting methods and also allowing for different time steps for each process. The stability, accuracy, and efficiency of MISDC methods are first analyzed using a linear model problem and the results are compared to semi-implicit spectral deferred correction methods. Furthermore, numerical tests on simplified reacting flows demonstrate the expected convergence rates for MISDC methods of orders three, four, and five. The gain in efficiency by independently controlling the sub-process time steps is illustrated for nonlinear problems, where reaction and diffusion are much stiffer than advection. Although the paper focuses on this specific time-scales ordering, the generalization to any ordering combination is straightforward. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new resolution strategy for multi-scale streamer discharge simulations based on a second order time adaptive integration and space adaptive multiresolution. A classical fluid model is used to describe plasma discharges, considering drift–diffusion equations and the computation of electric field. The proposed numerical method provides a time-space accuracy control of the solution, and thus, an effective accurate resolution independent of the fastest physical time scale. An important improvement of the computational efficiency is achieved whenever the required time steps go beyond standard stability constraints associated with mesh size or source time scales for the resolution of the drift–diffusion equations, whereas the stability constraint related to the dielectric relaxation time scale is respected but with a second order precision. Numerical illustrations show that the strategy can be efficiently applied to simulate the propagation of highly nonlinear ionizing waves as streamer discharges, as well as highly multi-scale nanosecond repetitively pulsed discharges, describing consistently a broad spectrum of space and time scales as well as different physical scenarios for consecutive discharge/post-discharge phases, out of reach of standard non-adaptive methods.},

abstract = {Particularly intense lightning discharges can produce transient luminous events above thunderclouds, termed sprites, elves and jets. These short lived optical emissions in the mesosphere can reach from the tops of thunderclouds up to the ionosphere; they provide direct evidence of coupling from the lower atmosphere to the upper atmosphere. Sprites are arguably the most dramatic recent discovery in solar-terrestrial physics. Shortly after the first ground based video recordings of sprites, observations on board the Space Shuttle detected sprites and elves occurring all around the world. These reports led to detailed sprite observations in North America, South America, Australia, Japan, and Europe. Subsequently, sprites were detected from other space platforms such as the International Space Station and the ROCSAT satellite. During the past 15 years, more than 200 contributions on sprites have been published in the scientific literature to document this rapidly evolving new research area. The need for international information exchange was quickly recognized, and sprite sessions became a permanent feature with a constantly growing number of contributions in the scientific communities of the American Geophysical Union (AGU), the International Union of Radio Science (URSI), the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) and the European Geosciences Union (EGU). The idea for a summer school on sprites was born during an informal meet- ing at Tohoku University in 2001, where a number of young scientists gave extended lectures on the details of their scientific work to interested colleagues following an invitation from Yukihiro Takahashi. This experience was felt to be so rewarding that, during the third SPECIAL Scientific Network meeting of the European Science Foundation held in Cambridge, 2002, an organising committee was formed to attract support for a NATO Advanced Study Institute on “Sprites, Elves and Intense Lightning Discharges”. The proposal was ac- cepted byNATOshortly thereafter and the Advanced Study Institute took place at the University of Corsica, in Corte on Corsica, from 24-31 July, 2004. The activity was co-sponsored by the European Science Foundation (ESF), the Re- search Training Network (RTN) “Connecting Atmospheric Layers” (CAL) of the European Commission (EC) and the International Union of Radio Science (URSI). About 80 scientists attended this first summer school on sprites, which was a scientifically excellent, exciting, interactive, and memorable event. The lectures delivered are presented in this book, along with the abstracts of the poster presentations by the young scientists. The book begins with an introduction to the electrical properties of the atmosphere, which sets the scene. Subsequently, the book is organised into four general themes of sprite research. The first theme describes the meteorological conditions for intense lightning discharges which are needed to produce sprites. The second theme describes the experiments for making optical observations of sprites from the ground and space. The third theme deals with radiowaves in the ULF/ELF/VLF frequency range from 3 Hz to 30 kHz, which occur in association with intense lightning discharges and sprites. The book finally wraps up the results within theme four, on theory and modelling in all three experimental areas of sprite research. The Editors thank the lecturers for their strong committment to deliver their scientific knowledge in oral and written from, and also the young scientists for their poster presentations. The Editors also thank Bettina Zapfe for her careful copy-editing of the book and, in particular, for her organisation of the index and the references. The organisers of the summer school express their gratitude to all the sponsors, who helped with substantial travel support. The organisers also thank the University of Corsica for hosting the meeting and Dominique Grandjean for her local support on site. The sprite summer school would not have been so successful without the helping hands of Norma Crosby, Thomas Farges, Ingrid H{\"{o}}rnchen, Tai-Yin Huang, Thomas Ulich, and many others.},

Because positive streamers propagate opposite to the electron drift velocity, their growth not only depends on the local electric field, but also on the electron density ahead of them. We have recently demonstrated the importance of this electron density, by showing that positive streamers could be guided by weak preionization from a laser. Here, we study streamer guiding in nitrogen-oxygen mixtures in more detail, to better understand the propagation of positive streamers. First, the conditions required for guiding are investigated, both experimentally and with three-dimensional numerical simulations. Particular focus is on the role of oxygen and photoionization, which tend to inhibit guiding. Then the position of the guided streamers is investigated, and successfully related to the electron drift.},

The effect of these discharges on bacteria was studied using water contaminated with Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis, the latter in both the vegetative and spore state. The strongest effect was obtained on E. coli. The concentration of E. coli could be reduced by three orders of magnitude after applying eight corona discharges to the water. The corresponding energy expenditure is 10 J/cm3. The decontamination rate had the largest values at the beginning, and decreased considerably after 15 electrical discharges, reaching a constant residual concentration value of 10-4 of the initial concentration. For B. subtilis in the vegetative state, it took almost 30 discharges to reach the same result, corresponding to an energy expenditure of 40 J/cm3. There was no effect on B. subtilis spores. Comparisons with the pulsed-electric field (PEF) method indicate that the decontamination efficiency of the PWC method is slightly higher than that of the PEF method.},

Such coefficients are usually calculated from collision cross-section data by solving the electron Boltzmann equation (BE). In this paper we present a new user-friendly BE solver developed especially for this purpose, freely available under the name BOLSIG+, which is more general and easier to use than most other BE solvers available. The solver provides steady-state solutions of the BE for electrons in a uniform electric field, using the classical two-term expansion, and is able to account for different growth models, quasi-stationary and oscillating fields, electron–neutral collisions and electron–electron collisions. We show that for the approximations we use, the BE takes the form of a convection-diffusion continuity-equation with a non-local source term in energy space. To solve this equation we use an exponential scheme commonly used for convection-diffusion problems. The calculated electron transport coefficients and rate coefficients are defined so as to ensure maximum consistency with the fluid equations. We discuss how these coefficients are best used in fluid models and illustrate the influence of some essential parameters and approximations.},

Positive high voltage pulses of order tens of kV and duration of tens of nanoseconds were applied to the powered inner cylindrical electrode which resulted in the formation and propagation of a cathode-directed streamer. The resulting spatial and temporal production of active radical species such as O, H, and singlet delta oxygen is quantified and compared for lean and stoichiometric fuel-air mixtures. For the coaxial electrode geometry, the discharge is characterized by a primary streamer that bridges the inter-electrode gap and a secondary streamer that develops in the wake of the primary streamer. Most of the radicals are produced in the secondary streamer. For the corona geometry, only the primary streamer is observed and the radicals are produced throughout the length of the primary streamer column. The stoichiometry of the mixture was observed to have a relatively small effect on both the plasma discharge structure and the resulting yield of radical species. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional numerical simulations of streamer development in a surface dielectric barrier discharge excited by a voltage pulse with a duration of 30--50 ns in atmospheric air show that the streamer propagation velocity is mainly governed by the velocity of potential diffusion along streamer channels. The calculated streamer length substantially exceeds the experimentally observed one due to the long-term conservation of the conductivity of these channels. A hypothesis on the three-dimensional character of the decay of the surface streamer channel is proposed. The model account of this effect in two-dimensional simulations reduces the calculated time of streamer development and the calculated streamer length to the experimentally observed values.},

abstract = {Streamer discharges pose basic problems in plasma physics, as they are very transient, far from equilibrium and have high ionization density gradients; they appear in diverse areas of science and technology. The present paper focuses on the derivation of a high order fluid model for streamers. Using momentum transfer theory, the fluid equations are obtained as velocity moments of the Boltzmann equation; they are closed in the local mean energy approximation and coupled to the Poisson equation for the space charge generated electric field. The high order tensor in the energy flux equation is approximated by the product of two lower order moments to close the system. The average collision frequencies for momentum and energy transfer in elastic and inelastic collisions for electrons in molecular nitrogen are calculated from a multi term Boltzmann equation solution. We then discuss, in particular, (1) the correct implementation of transport data in streamer models; (2) the accuracy of the two term approximation for solving Boltzmann's equation in the context of streamer studies; and (3) the evaluation of the mean-energy-dependent collision rates for electrons required as an input in the high order fluid model. In the second paper in this sequence, we will discuss the solutions of the high order fluid model for streamers, based on model and input data derived in the present paper.},

The dynamics of streamers intersecting such particles are of interest due to their possible use for functionalizing the surfaces of the particles. Using a 2-dimensional plasma hydrodynamics model having an unstructured mesh, the consequences of dust particles on streamer dynamics were investigated while varying the particle size, shape and material properties. We found that while small dielectric particles ({\textless} tens of micrometres) are enveloped by the streamer, larger particles can intercept and reinitiate streamers. By increasing the permittivity and capacitance of the particles, streamer interception and re-initiation may also occur on smaller particles. The presence of multiple particles in the path of a streamer can increase the speed of the avalanche front due to synergistic polarization of the particles.},

abstract = {Positive and negative streamers are studied in ambient air at 1 bar; they emerge from a needle electrode placed 40 mm above a planar electrode. The amplitudes of the applied voltage pulses range from 5 to 96 kV; most pulses have rise times of 30 ns or shorter. Diameters, velocities and energies of the streamers are measured. Two regimes are identified; a low voltage regime where only positive streamers appear and a high voltage regime where both positive and negative streamers exist. Below 5 kV, no streamers emerge. In the range from 5 to 40 kV, positive streamers form, while the negative discharges only form a glowing cloud at the electrode tip, but no streamers. For 5 to 20 kV, diameters and velocities of the positive streamers have the minimal values of d=0.2 mm and v $\backslash$approx 10{\^{}}5 m/s. For 20 to 40 kV, their diameters increase by a factor 6 while the voltage increases only by a factor 2. Above the transition value of 40 kV, streamers of both polarities form; they strongly resemble each other, though the positive ones propagate further; their diameters continue to increase with applied voltage. For 96 kV, positive streamers attain diameters of 3 mm and velocities of 4*10{\^{}}6 m/s, negative streamers are about 20 {\%} slower and thinner. An empirical fit formula for the relation between velocity v and diameter d is v=0.5 d{\^{}}2/(mm ns) for both polarities. Streamers of both polarities dissipate energies of the order of several mJ per streamer while crossing the gap.},

abstract = {Aqueous phase pulsed streamer corona reactors are currently under development for a number of applications including water and wastewater treatment. Previous research has demonstrated that a high voltage pulsed electrical discharge directly into water leads to the formation of reactive species such as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. Since significant quantities of hydrogen peroxide are produced, the role of Fenton's reactions in the pulsed corona reactor is analyzed both experimentally and with computer simulations in the present work. Experimental data shows the existence of optimal iron concentrations for the degradation of phenol, and that the formation of hydrogen peroxide by the pulsed corona discharge is dependent upon both the applied electric field and the solution conductivity. A mathematical model based upon mass balances for 31 radical and molecular species in the batch reactor (including 71 chemical reactions) has been developed and sensitivity analysis performed to identify key reactions. This model is used to show the effects of initial reaction conditions (including iron and phenol concentrations) on the degradation of phenol and the formation of reaction intermediate products and by-products. The model results are in qualitative and semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental observations on the effects of initial iron and phenol concentrations on phenol degradation and by-product formation.},

abstract = {Glow discharge at atmospheric pressure using a dielectric barrier discharge can induce fluid flow, and operate as an actuator for flow control. In this paper, we simulate the physics of a 2-D asymmetric actuator operating in Helium gas using a high-fidelity first principles-based numerical modeling approach to help improve our understanding of the physical mechanisms associated with such actuators. Fundamentally, there are two processes in the two half-cycles of the actuator operation, largely due to the difference in mobility between faster electrons and slower ions, and the geometric configurations of the DBD/electrodes. The first half-cycle is characterized by the deposition of the slower ion species on the insulator surface while the second half-cycle by the deposition of the electrons at a faster rate. A power-law (cubic) dependence on the voltage for the resulting force is observed, which indicates that larger force can be generated by increasing the amplitude. Furthermore, one can enhance the effectiveness of the actuator, by either increasing the peak value of the periodic force generation or by increasing the asymmetry between the voltage half-cycles or both. Overall, the increase in the lower electrode size, applied voltage and dielectric constant tends to contribute to the first factor, and the decrease in frequency of applied voltage tends to contribute to the second factor. However, the complex interplay between the above factors determines the actuator performance.},

We demonstrate that the introduction of a packing of dielectric zirconia (ZrO2) beads into a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor can enhance the CO2 conversion and energy efficiency up to a factor 1.9 and 2.2, respectively, compared to that in a normal (unpacked) DBD reactor. We obtained a maximum conversion of 42 {\%} and a maximum energy efficiency of 9.6 {\%}. However, it is the ability of the packing to almost double both the conversion and the energy efficiency simultaneously at certain input parameters that makes it very promising. The improved conversion and energy efficiency can be explained by the higher values of the local electric field and electron energy near the contact points of the beads and the lower breakdown voltage, demonstrated by 2 D fluid modeling.},

We first review the discrete velocity method for solving Boltzmann and Wang Chang–Uhlenbeck kinetic equations for rarefied gases. Then, peculiarities of AMR implementation with octree Cartesian mesh are discussed. A Unified Flow Solver (UFS) uses AMAR method with adaptive Cartesian mesh to dynamically introduce kinetic patches for multi-scale simulations of gas flows. We describe fluid plasma models with AMR capabilities and illustrate how physical models affect simulation results for gas discharges, especially in the areas where electron kinetics plays an important role. We introduce Eulerian solvers for plasma kinetic equations and illustrate the concept of adaptive mesh in velocity space. Specifics of electron kinetics in collisional plasmas are described focusing on deterministic methods of solving kinetic equations for electrons under different conditions. We illustrate the appearance of distinct groups of electrons in the cathode region of DC discharges and discuss the physical models appropriate for each group.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC. A 3-dimensional particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision simulation that is fully implemented on a graphics processing unit (GPU) is described and used to determine low-temperature plasma characteristics at high reduced electric field, E/n, in nitrogen gas. Details of implementation on the GPU using the NVIDIA Compute Unified Device Architecture framework are discussed with respect to efficient code execution. The software is capable of tracking around 10 × 10 6  particles with dynamic weighting and a total mesh size larger than 108 cells. Verification of the simulation is performed by comparing the electron energy distribution function and plasma transport parameters to known Boltzmann Equation (BE) solvers. Under the assumption of a uniform electric field and neglecting the build-up of positive ion space charge, the simulation agrees well with the BE solvers. The model is utilized to calculate plasma characteristics of a pulsed, parallel plate discharge. A photoionization model provides the simulation with additional electrons after the initial seeded electron density has drifted towards the anode. Comparison of the performance benefits between the GPU-implementation versus a CPU-implementation is considered, and a speed-up factor of 13 for a 3D relaxation Poisson solver is obtained. Furthermore, a factor 60 speed-up is realized for parallelization of the electron processes.},

abstract = {As part of a systematic study of approximations commonly made in solutions of the Boltzmann equation for electrons in molecular gases, we have investigated the effects of anisotropic scattering on electron transport coefficients in N2 and have extended our study of the multiterm expansion technique to higher E/n. A critical survey of published data yields a set of differential and integral cross sections for electron energies from 0.003 to 10 eV. For electric-field — to — gas-density ratios E/n between 10 and 500 Td (1 Td=10 ' V m), the changes in the commonly measured transport and reaction coefficients resulting from the introduction of anisotropic elastic and inelastic scatter-ing, while keeping the elastic momentum-transfer cross section constant, are less than 1{\%}. These calculations were made with use of the multiterm spherical-harmonic expansion solution of the Boltzmann equation. For 500 {\&}E/n {\&} 1500 Td the changes in scattering anisotropy cause changes in transport and reaction coefficients which increase with E/n to about 10{\%}. The errors in drift velocity, mean energy, and the reaction coefficients resulting from the use of the two-term spherical-harmonic expansion rather than a six-term expansion are less than 3{\%}{\%}uo at 1500 Td. How-ever, the errors in the diffusion coefficients become large ({\~{}} 25{\%}) at our highest E/n. The calculat-ed transport coefficients are in generally good agreement with experiment for E/n less than 300 Td, but the differences increase at higher E/n. The importance of proper interpretation of ionization and excitation experiments at high E/n is illustrated by calculations which model either an ex-ponential growth of density in time or an exponential growth with position. The calculated ioniza-tion coefficients are low compared to most experiments for E/n less than 200 Td. At E/n {\~{}} 600 Td the agreement is good for the spatial growth experiments, but the calculated values are below ex-periment from the temporal growth experiments. The calculated excitation coefficients are general-ly higher than experiment at low and high E/n but in agreement with experiment at E/n near 150 Td.},

This similarity is based on Townsend scaling with air density. First the theoretical basis of Townsend scaling and a list of six possible corrections to scaling are discussed; then the experimental evidence for the similarity between streamers and sprites is reviewed. We then discuss how far present sprite and streamer theory has been developed, and we show how streamer experiments can be interpreted as sprite simulations. We review those results of recent streamer research that are relevant for sprites and other forms of atmospheric electricity and discuss their implications for sprite understanding. These include the large range of streamer diameters and velocities and the overall 3D morphology with branching, interaction and reconnection, the dependence on voltage and polarity, the electron energies in the streamer head and the consecutive chemical efficiency and hard radiation. New theoretical and experimental results concern measurements of streamer spectra in air, the density dependence of streamer heating (hot leaders are unlikely at 80 km altitude and cold streamers are unlikely in liquids), and a discussion of the influence of magnetic fields on thermal electrons or on energetic electrons in streamers or sprites.},

abstract = {Pulsed discharges in high-pressure gases are of considerable interest as sources of nonequilibrium plasma for various technological applications: pollution control, pumping of laser media, plasma-assisted combustion, etc. Recently, attention has been attracted to the use of subnanosecond voltage fronts, producing diffuse discharges with radii of several millimeters. Such plasma structures, similar to pulsed glow discharges, are of special interest for applications due to quasi-uniformity of plasma parameters in relatively large gas volumes. This review presents the results of experimental and computational study of subnanosecond diffuse discharge formation. A description of generators of short high-voltage pulses with subnanosecond fronts and of discharge setups is given. Diagnostic methods for the measurement of various discharge parameters with high temporal and spatial resolution are described. Obtained experimental data on plasma properties for a wide range of governing factors are discussed. A review of various theoretical approaches used for computational study of the dynamics and structure of fast ionization waves is given; the applicability of conventional fluid streamer models for simulation of subnanosecond ionization waves is discussed. Calculated spatial-temporal profiles of plasma parameters during streamer propagation are presented. The efficiency of subnanosecond discharges for the production of reactive species is evaluated. On the basis of the comparison of simulation results and experimental data the effects of various factors (voltage rise time, polarity, etc.) on discharge characteristics are revealed. The major physical phenomena governing the properties of subnanosecond breakdown are analyzed.},

abstract = {An important tool for improving the reliability of HV insulation systems are partial discharge (PD) measurements. The interpretation of such measurements aims at extracting from the measured data information about insulation defects which then are used for estimating the risk of insulation failure of the equipment. Because the physical understanding of PD has made substantial progress in the last decade, it can now be exploited to support interpretation. In this paper a concept is presented which merges the available physical knowledge about various PD types into a generalized model which can be applied to arbitrary insulation defects. This approach will be restricted to PD of the streamer type in gases and at gas-insulator interfaces which cover a large fraction of the cases encountered in technical insulation systems. The generalized model allows us to derive approximate relations between defect characteristics, insulation design parameters and test conditions on one side, and measurable PD characteristics on the other. The inversion of these relations yields rules for extracting defect information from the PD data. The application of the generalized model is illustrated by two simple examples, namely, spherical voids in an insulator and electrode protrusions in SF6},

abstract = {Abstract Electric field values measured inside thunderclouds have consistently been reported to be up to an order of magnitude lower than the value required for the conventional electrical breakdown of air. This result has made it difficult to explain how lightning frequently occurs in thunderclouds. A few different theories have been offered to explain the lightning initiation process, one of them being the theory of lightning initiation from hydrometeors. According to this theory, lightning can be initiated from electrical discharges originating around thundercloud water or ice particles in the measured thundercloud electric field. These particles, called hydrometeors, are believed to cause significant enhancement of the thundercloud electric field in their vicinity and then initiate streamers that are the precursor discharges for the hot lightning leader channel. Previously, Liu et al. (2012a) reported streamer formation from a model hydrometeor in an electric field value of half of the conventional breakdown threshold (Ek) for air. In this paper, we present modeling results for streamer formation in electric fields as low as one third of the breakdown threshold. According to our results, initiation of stable streamers from thundercloud hydrometeors in a 0.3Ek electric field is possible, only if enhanced ambient ionization levels (e.g., the ionization created by corona discharges around the same or other nearby hydrometeors) are present ahead of the streamer. The magnitude and distribution of this ambient density may be a determining factor on whether the streamer branches, recovers after the prebranching stage, or continues propagating stably. We investigate the streamer branching behavior and characteristics and test a theory that has recently been proposed to explain this phenomenon. We find that the geometry of the streamer head plays an important role in the streamer branching phenomena. The fast radial movement of the maximum streamer head curvature, combined with the slow reduction of the maximum curvature value, eventually leads the streamer head to branching. Finally, we compare our modeling results with laboratory experiments and realistic thundercloud conditions and discuss the implications of this study to lightning initiation and other lightning-related phenomena.},

abstract = {Electric discharges and streamers in liquids typically proceed through vapour phase channels produced by the streamer or in gaseous bubbles. The bubbles can originate by enthalpy changes produced by the discharge or can be artificially injected into the liquid. Experiments on streamers in bubbles immersed in liquids have shown that the discharge propagates either along the surface of the bubble or through the volume of the bubble as in conventional streamer propagation in air. In this paper we report on results of a computational investigation of streamer propagation through bubbles immersed in liquids. We found that the dielectric constant of the liquid in large part determines the path the streamer takes. Streamers in bubbles immersed in a liquid with a high permittivity preferentially propagate along the surface of the bubble. Liquids with low permittivity can result in the streamer propagating along the axis of the bubble. The permittivity at which this transition occurs is a function of the applied voltage, size of the bubble and the conductivity of the liquid},

Several modifications and variations to the original spectral deferred corrections method by Dutt, Greengard, and Rokhlin concerning the choice of integration points and the form of the correction iteration are presented. The stability and accuracy of the resulting ODE methods for both stiff and nonstiff problems are explored analytically and numerically. The SISDC methods are intended to be combined with the method of lines approach to yield a flexible framework for creating higher-order semi-implicit methods for partial differential equations. A discussion and numerical examples of the SISDC method applied to advection-diffusion type equations are included. The results suggest that higher-order SISDC methods are a competitive alternative to existing Runge-Kutta and linear multistep methods based on the accuracy per function evaluation.},

The M1 model is proved to be equivalent to the hydrodynamic equations of ultra relativistic particles. We show two forms: one expressed with the classical Newtonian velocity and the other expressed with the relativistic four velocity. We use the enthalpy density, i.e. the sum of the energy density and the isotropic component of the pressure, instead of the energy density in both forms. The former serves to show us that the ratio of the flux to the enthalpy density denotes the bulk velocity of the radiation in the M1 model. The latter serves us to propose a Lorentz invariant form useful for taking account of the Doppler shift.},

The pulsed streamer corona produces energetic free electrons, which dissociate gas molecules, forming radicals. These radicals cause chemical reactions that convert SO2 and NOx into acid mists and/or solids, which can be removed from the gas stream by conventional means.

abstract = {Transient discharges at atmospheric pressures are being applied nowadays in many applications [1]. Typical  configurations are pulsed corona, dielectric barrier and packed bed discharges. The term transient implies here  that the discharge exists only as long as it is propagating. Two ways of propagation can be distinguished:  through a gas or along a dielectric. In this paper the propagation through the gas phase will be considered in a  positive corona. This discharge has been studied for many years in experiments and calculations [1].  Nevertheless many aspects have not been resolved. The transient character and the small dimensions make the  discharges difficult to access by measurements. Therefore parameters like electron density and energy, electric  field strength and radical densities are only estimated up to now. The calculations encounter similar problems.  The discharge has very strong gradients in space and time and most of the rate constants of the processes  involved can only be estimated. At present the state-of-the-art of streamer simulations is a 2-D model in the  hydrodynamic approach.  },

abstract = {This paper presents an electro-thermal hydrodynamic model that explains the development of different streamer modes in transformer oil. The focus is on the difference between the slow 2nd and fast 3rd mode streamers discussed in the literature. Through the use of numerical methods the model demonstrates that streamer modes arise in transformer oil due to the electric field dependent molecular ionization of different families of hydrocarbon molecules (i.e., aromatic, naphthenic, and paraffinic) at increasing electric field levels (or applied voltages). Ionization of the low number density aromatic molecules, that generally have lower ionization energies than naphthenic/paraffinic molecules, leads to the propagation of 2nd mode streamers with velocities on the order of 1 km/s. As the applied voltage is increased, the ionization of the main hydrocarbon molecules in transformer oil, high number density naphthenic/paraffinic molecules, dominates producing high electric field levels and space charge at the streamer tip. This ultimately leads to the propagation of the 3rd mode streamer with velocities on the order of 10 km/s.},

abstract = {The term plasma actuator has now been a part of the fluid dynamics flow- control vernacular for more than a decade. A particular type of plasma actu- ator that has gained wide use is based on a single–dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) mechanism that has desirable features for use in air at atmospheric pressures. For these actuators, the mechanism of flow control is through a generated body-force vector field that couples with the momentum in the external flow. The body force can be derived from first principles, and the effect of plasma actuators can be easily incorporated into flow solvers so that their placement and operation can be optimized. They have been used in a wide range of internal and external flow applications. Although ini- tially considered useful only at low speeds, plasma actuators are effective in a number of applications at high subsonic, transonic, and supersonic Mach numbers, owing largely to more optimized actuator designs that were de- veloped through better understanding and modeling of the actuator physics. New applications continue to appear through a growing number of pro- grams in the United States, Germany, France, England, the Netherlands, Russia, Australia, Japan, and China. This review provides an overview of the physics and modeling of SDBD plasma actuators. It highlights some of the capabilities of plasma actuators through examples from experiments and simulations.},

abstract = {The branching of electric discharge streamers in atmospheric pressure air, dense gases and liquids is a common occurrence whose origins are likely found with many causes, both deterministic and stochastic. One mechanism for streamer branching may be inhomogeneities in the path of a streamer which either divert the streamer (typically a region of lower ionization) or produce a new branch (a region of higher ionization). The propagation and branching of streamers in liquids is likely aided by low density inhomogeneities, bubbles; however, modeling of streamers in liquids is made difficult by the lack of transport coefficients. As a first step towards understanding the propagation and branching of streamers in liquids, we investigated the consequences of random inhomogeneities in the form of low pressure bubbles on the propagation of streamers in high pressure humid air. By virtue of their lower density, bubbles have larger E/N (electric field/gas number density) than the ambient gas with larger rates of ionization. The intersection of a streamer with a bubble will focus the plasma into the bubble by virtue of that higher rate of ionization but the details of the interaction depend on the relative sizes of the bubble and streamer. When a streamer intersects a field of bubbles, the large E/N in the bubble avalanches seed electrons produced by photoionization from the streamer. Each bubble then launches both a negative and positive going streamer that may link with those from adjacent bubbles or the original streamer. The total process then appears as streamer branching.},

We here present first results in this setup on positive streamers in air at fixed voltage and varying electrode distance. While next to the emitting anode tip, a similar number of streamers seems to emerge due to multiple branching, more streamers seem to survive over a fixed distance, when the gap is shorter.

abstract = {To simulate the coupled plasma and fluid flow physics of dielectric-barrier discharge, a plasma–fluid model is utilized in conjunction with a compressible flow solver. The flow solver is responsible for determining the bulk flow kinetics of dominant neutral background species including mole fractions, gas temperature, pressure and velocity. The plasma solver determines the kinetics and energetics of the plasma species and accounts for finite rate chemistry. In order to achieve maximum reliability and best performance, we have utilized state-of-the-art numerical and theoretical approaches for the simulation of DBD plasma actuators. In this respect, to obtain a stable and accurate solution method, we tested and compared different existing numerical procedures, including operator-splitting algorithm, super-time-stepping, and solution of the Poisson and transport equations in a semi-implicit manner. The implementation of the model is conducted in OpenFOAM. Four numerical test cases are considered in order to validate the solvers and to investigate the drawbacks/benefits of the solution approaches. The test problems include single DBD actuator driven by positive, negative and sinusoidal voltage waveforms, similar to the ones that could be found in literature. The accuracy of the results strongly depends to the choice of time step, grid size and discretization scheme. The results indicate that the super-time-stepping treatment improves the computational efficiency in comparison to explicit schemes. However, the semi-implicit treatment of the Poisson and transport equations showed better performance compared to the other tested approaches.},

abstract = {Modeling studies indicate that double-headed streamers originating from single electron avalanches in lightning-driven quasi-static electric fields at mesospheric altitudes accelerate and expand, reaching transverse scales from tens to a few hundreds of meters and propagation speeds up to one tenth of the speed of light, in good agreement with recent telescopic, high-speed video and multichannel photometric observations of sprites. The preionization of the medium ahead of a streamer by the ionizing UV photons originating from a region of high electric field in the streamer head (i.e., photoionization) significantly modifies the streamer scaling properties as a function of air pressure in comparison with those predicted by similarity laws. The photoionization leads to lower peak electric fields in the streamer head, lower streamer electron densities, wider initial streamer structures, and lower acceleration and expansion rates of streamers at sprite altitudes 40–90 km, when compared to the ground level. The primary reason for the observed differences is that the effective quenching altitude of the excited states of the molecular nitrogen b 1$\Pi$ u , b′1 , and c′4 1 that give photoionizing radiation is about 24 km. The quenching of these states is therefore negligible at sprite altitudes, leading to a substantial enhancement of the electron-ion pair production ahead of the streamer tip because of the photoionization, when compared to the ground level. The maximum radius of the expanding streamers is predominantly controlled by the combination of the absorption cross section $\chi$min = 3.5 × 10−2 cm−1 Torr−1 of the molecular oxygen (O2) at 1025 {\AA} and the partial pressure of O2 in air, p O2 . Streamers exhibit branching when their radius becomes greater than 1/$\chi$min p O2 . Model results indicate a lower branching threshold radius for positive streamers in comparison with negative streamers, under otherwise identical ambient conditions. These results are in good agreement with recent results of high-speed photography of laboratory streamers in near-atmospheric pressure N2/O2 mixtures and similar morphology documented during recent telescopic and high-speed video observations of sprites.},

abstract = {? 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.This paper reports the results of a preliminary investigation on the interaction of a streamer discharge in air with bubbles filled with air and floating on a liquid surface. The bubbles are formed of tap water and transformer oil. It was shown that the strike of the streamer in a bubble is followed by the full bubble destroying. However, scenarios of the streamer discharge interaction with a conductive water bubble and dielectric oil bubble are different in their concrete details. A positive streamer smoothly and slowly slides on an external surface of a water bubble, but the streamer striking in an oil bubble quickly perforates it and penetrates into the bubble. The mechanisms for water and oil bubble destroying are discussed. The applicability of the results obtained to plasma-liquid systems based on the use of foam is discussed as well.},

@article{Chanrion2008,
abstract = {A particle code has been developed to study the distribution and acceleration of electrons in electric discharges in air. The code can follow the evolution of a discharge from the initial stage of a single free electron in a background electric field to the formation of an electron avalanche and its transition into a streamer. The code is in 2D axi-symmetric coordinates, allowing quasi 3D simulations during the initial stages of streamer formation. This is important for realistic simulations of problems where space charge fields are essential such as in streamer formation. The charged particles are followed in a Cartesian mesh and the electric field is updated with Poisson's equation from the charged particle densities. Collisional processes between electrons and air molecules are simulated with a Monte Carlo technique, according to cross section probabilities. The code also includes photoionisation processes of air molecules by photons emitted by excited constituents. The paper describes the code and presents some results of streamer development at 70 km altitude in the mesosphere where electrical discharges (sprites) are generated above severe thunderstorms and at ∼10 km relevant for lightning and thundercloud electrification. The code is used to study acceleration of thermal seed electrons in streamers and to understand the conditions under which electrons may reach energies in the runaway regime. This is the first study in air, with a particle model with realistic spatial dependencies of the electrostatic field. It is shown that at 1 atm pressure the electric field must exceed ∼7.5 times the breakdown field to observe runaway electrons in a constant electric field. This value is close to the field where the electric force on an electron equals the maximum frictional force on an electron - found at ∼100 eV. It is also found that this value is reached in a negative streamer tip at 10 km altitude when the background electric field equals ∼3 times the breakdown field. At higher altitudes, the background electric field must be relatively larger to create a similar field in a streamer tip because of increased influence of photoionisation. It is shown that the role of photoionization increases with altitude and the effect is to decrease the space charge fields and increase the streamer propagation velocity. Finally, effects of electrons in the runaway regime on negative streamer dynamics are presented. It is shown the energetic electrons create enhanced ionization in front of negative streamers. The simulations suggest that the thermal runaway mechanism may operate at lower altitudes and be associated with lightning and thundercloud electrification while the mechanism is unlikely to be important in sprite generation at higher altitudes in the mesosphere. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Gunney2016,
abstract = {Patch-based structured adaptive mesh refinement (SAMR) is widely used for high-resolution simulations. Combined with modern supercomputers, it could provide simulations of unprecedented size and resolution. A persistent challenge for this combination has been managing dynamically adaptive meshes on more and more MPI tasks. The distributed mesh management scheme in SAMRAI has made some progress SAMR scalability, but early algorithms still had trouble scaling past the regime of 105 MPI tasks. This work provides two critical SAMR regridding algorithms, which are integrated into that scheme to ensure efficiency of the whole. The clustering algorithm is an extension of the tile-clustering approach, making it more flexible and efficient in both clustering and parallelism. The partitioner is a new algorithm designed to prevent the network congestion experienced by its predecessor. We evaluated performance using weak- and strong-scaling benchmarks designed to be difficult for dynamic adaptivity. Results show good scaling on up to 1.5M cores and 2M MPI tasks. Detailed timing diagnostics suggest scaling would continue well past that.},

Theory implies that tau leaping should be accurate so long as no propensity function changes its value "significantly" during any time step τ. Presented here is an improved procedure for estimating the largest value for τ that is consistent with this condition. This new τ -selection procedure is more accurate, easier to code, and faster to execute than the currently used procedure. The speedup in execution will be especially pronounced in systems that have many reaction channels. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Gillespie1977,
   abstract = {There are two formalisms for mathematically describing the time behavior of a spatially homogeneous chemical system: The deterministic approach regards the time evolution as a continuous, wholly predictable process which is governed by a set of coupled, ordinary differential equations (the "reaction-rate equations"); the stochastic approach regards the time evolution as a kind of random-walk process which is governed by a single differential-difference equation (the "master equation"). Fairly simple kinetic theory arguments show that the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics has a firmer physical basis than the deterministic formulation, but unfortunately the stochastic master equation is often mathematically intractable. There is, however, a way to make exact numerical calculations within the framework of the stochastic formulation without having to deal with the master equation directly. It is a relatively simple digital computer algorithm which uses a rigorously derived Monte Carlo procedure to numerically simulate the time evolution of the given chemical system. Like the master equation, this "stochastic simulation algorithm" correctly accounts for the inherent fluctuations and correlations that are necessarily ignored in the deterministic formulation. In addition, unlike most procedures for numerically solving the deterministic reaction-rate equations, this algorithm never approximates infinitesimal time increments dt by finite time steps Δt. The feasibility and utility of the simulation algorithm are demonstrated by applying it to several well-known model chemical systems, including the Lotka model, the Brusselator, and the Oregonator.},

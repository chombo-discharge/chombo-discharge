   abstract = {<p>Atmospheric pressure plasmas intersecting with dielectric surfaces will often transition into surface ionization waves (SIWs). Several applications of these discharges are purposely configured to be SIWs. During propagation of an SIW over a dielectric surface, the plasma charges the surface while responding to changes in geometrical and electrical material properties. This is particularly important for non-planar surfaces where polarization of the dielectric results in local electric field enhancement. In this paper, we discuss results from computational investigations of negative and positive SIWs propagating over nonplanar dielectrics in three configurations—wavy surfaces, cuts through porous materials and water droplets on flat surfaces. We found that negative SIWs are particularly sensitive to the electric field enhancement that occurs at the crests of non-planar surfaces. The local increase in ionization rates by the electric field enhancement can result in the SIW detaching from the surface, which produces non-uniform plasma exposure of the surface. Positive SIWs tend to adhere to the surface to a greater degree. These trends indicate that treatment of pathogen containing droplets on surfaces may be best performed by positive SIWs. The same principles apply to the surfaces cut through pores. Buried pores with small openings to the SIW may be filled by plasma by either flow of plasma into the pore (large opening) or initiated by photoionization (small opening), depending on the size of the opening compared to the Debye length.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>We investigate the propagation of positive streamers along a profiled dielectric surface in air at atmospheric pressure. Results from experiments and two-dimensional planar low-temperature plasma fluid simulations are presented and analysed. The test object consists of a disk-shaped high voltage electrode and a dielectric slab with 0.5 mm deep corrugations. The corrugated surface has a 47% larger surface area than the smooth reference surface. The experiments and simulations are performed at voltage levels that lead to either gap-bridging or arrested streamers. In both experiments and simulations, the streamers take a longer time to reach the ground electrode when propagating along the profiled surface than along the smooth reference surface. Also, arrested streamers stop closer to the high voltage electrode when a profiled surface is used. Streamers propagate closely along the surface profile in the simulations, which suggests that the observed surface profile effect is mainly a result of elongated streamer channels. Compared to the streamers propagating along the smooth surface, the elongated streamers on the profiled surface have less residual voltage at the streamer front to drive the streamer advancement.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Pictures show that streamer or sprite discharge channels emerging from the same electrode sometimes seem to reconnect or merge though their heads carry electric charge of the same polarity; one might therefore suspect that reconnections are an artefact of the two-dimensional projection in the pictures. Here we use stereo photography to investigate the full three-dimensional structure of such events. We analyse reconnection, possibly an electrostatic effect in which a late thin streamer reconnects to an earlier thick streamer channel, and merging, a suggested photoionization effect in which two simultaneously propagating streamer heads merge into one new streamer. We use four different anode geometries (one tip, two tips, two asymmetric protrusions in a plate and a wire), placed 40 mm above a flat cathode plate in ambient air. A positive high voltage pulse is applied to the anode, creating a positive corona discharge. This discharge is studied with a fast ICCD camera, in many cases combined with optics to enable stereoscopic imaging. We find that reconnections as defined above occur frequently. Merging on the other hand was only observed at a pressure of 25 mbar and a tip separation of 2 mm, i.e. for a reduced tip distance of <italic>p</italic> · <italic>d</italic> = 50 µm bar. In this case the full width at half maximum of the streamer channel is more than 10 times as large as the tip separation. At higher pressures or with a wire anode, merging was not observed. </p>},

   abstract = {Atmospheric electricity has been intensively studied during the last 30 years after the discovery in 1989 of different forms of upper atmospheric electrical discharges (so–called Transient Luminous Events) triggered by lightning in the troposphere. In spite of the significant number of investigations that led to important new results unveiling how lightning produces a zoo of transient electrical discharges from the upper troposphere to the mesosphere, there is still no clear understanding about how all sort of TLEs – including those that occur inside thunderclouds – can contribute to the chemistry of the atmosphere both at the local and global scale. This review paper aims at presenting a perspective on the TLE atmospheric chemistry research done in the past, in the present as well as to describe some of the challenges that await ahead to find the true scientific importance of the non-equilibrium atmospheric chemistry triggered by TLEs. This review comes to conclude that while the global chemical impact of elves and halos are almost negligible, the large scale chemical impact of sprites, blue jets and blue starters and that of impulsive cloud corona discharges might be non–negligible in terms of their possibly measurable contribution to important greenhouse gases such as ozone and nitrous oxide (N2O). Being the third strongest greenhouse gas (after carbon dioxide and methane) and by having the ability to deplete ozone, precise determination of atmospheric N2O sources is of increasing and pressing demand. A new era in atmospheric electricity is just emerging in which dedicated scientific space missions (ISS–LIS, ASIM) together with geostationary lightning sensors (since 2016) and new micro–scale and parameterizations of TLEs in general atmospheric chemistry circulation models will hopefully help to start clarifying the full role of TLEs in the chemistry of the atmosphere.},

   abstract = {<p> Both fluid and particle models are commonly used to simulate streamer discharges. In this paper, we quantitatively study the agreement between these approaches for axisymmetric and 3D simulations of positive streamers in air. We use a drift–diffusion–reaction fluid model with the local field approximation and a particle-in-cell, Monte Carlo collision particle model. The simulations are performed at 300 K and 1 bar in a 10 mm plate–plate gap with a 2 mm needle electrode. Applied voltages between 11.7 and 15.6 kV are used, which correspond to background fields of about 15–20 kV cm <sup>−1</sup> . Streamer properties like maximal electric field, head position and velocity are compared as a function of time or space. Our results show good agreement between the particle and fluid simulations, in contrast to some earlier comparisons that were carried out in 1D or for negative streamers. To quantify discrepancies between the models, we mainly look at streamer velocities as a function of streamer length. For the test cases considered here, the mean deviation in streamer velocity between the particle and fluid simulations is less than 4%. We study the effect of different types of transport data for the fluid model, and find that flux coefficients lead to good agreement whereas bulk coefficients do not. Furthermore, we find that with a two-term Boltzmann solver, data should be computed using a temporal growth model for the best agreement. The numerical convergence of the particle and fluid models is also studied. In fluid simulations the streamer velocity increases somewhat using finer grids, whereas the particle simulations are less sensitive to the grid. Photoionization is the dominant source of stochastic fluctuations in our simulations. When the same stochastic photoionization model is used, particle and fluid simulations exhibit similar fluctuations. </p>},

   abstract = {Streamers are ionization fronts that occur in gases at atmospheric and sub-atmospheric pressures. Numerical studies of streamers are important for practical applications but are challenging due to the multiscale nature of this discharge type. This paper introduces a spectral element method for modelling streamer discharges. The method is developed for Cartesian grids but can be extended to be used on unstructured meshes. The streamer model is based on the Poisson equation for the electric potential and the electron continuity equation. The Poisson equation is discretized via a spectral method based on the integral representation of the solution. The hierarchical Poincaré - Steklov (HPS) scheme is used to solve the resulting set of equations. The electron continuity equation is solved by means of the discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM). The DGSEM is extended by an alternative definition of the diffusion flux. A subcell finite volume method is used to stabilize the DGSEM scheme, if required. The entire simulation scheme is validated by solving a number of test problems and reproducing the results of previous studies. Adaptive mesh refinement is used to reduce the number of unknowns. The proposed method is found to be sufficiently fast for being used in practical applications. The flexibility of the method provides an interesting opportunity to broaden the range of problems that can be addressed in numerical studies of low-temperature plasma discharges.},

   abstract = {We present a new fluid plasma solver with adaptive Cartesian mesh (ACM) based on a full-Newton (nonlinear, implicit) scheme for non-equilibrium gas discharge plasma. The electrons and ions are described using drift–diffusion approximation coupled to Poisson equation for the electric field. The electron-energy transport equation is solved to account for electron thermal conductivity, Joule heating, and energy loss of electrons in collisions with neutral species. The rate of electron-induced ionization is a function of electron temperature and could also depend on electron density (important for plasma stratification). The ion and gas temperature are kept constant. The transport equations are discretized using a non-isothermal Scharfetter–Gummel scheme to resolve possible large temperature gradients in the sheaths. We demonstrate the new solver for simulations of direct current (DC) and radiofrequency (RF) discharges. The implicit treatment of the coupled equations allows using large time steps. The full-Newton method (FNM) enables fast nonlinear convergence at each time step, offering significantly improved simulation efficiency. We discuss the selection of time steps for solving different plasma problems. The new solver enables solving several problems we could not solve before with existing software: two- and three-dimensional structures of the entire DC discharges including cathode and anode regions, electric field reversals and double-layer formation, the normal cathode spot and an anode ring, moving striations in diffuse and constricted DC discharges, and standing striations in RF discharges. The developed FNM-ACM technique offers many benefits for tackling the disparity of gas discharge plasma systems’ time scales and nonlinearity.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we address two main topics: steady propagation fields for positive streamers in air and streamer deceleration in fields below the steady propagation field. We generate constant-velocity positive streamers in air with an axisymmetric fluid model, by initially adjusting the applied voltage based on the streamer velocity. After an initial transient, we observe steady propagation for velocities of 3 × 104 m s−1 to 1.2 × 105 m s−1, during which streamer properties and the background field do not change. This propagation mode is not fully stable, in the sense that a small change in streamer properties or background field eventually leads to acceleration or deceleration. An important finding is that faster streamers are able to propagate in significantly lower background fields than slower ones, indicating that there is no unique stability field. We relate the streamer radius, velocity, maximal electric field and background electric field to a characteristic time scale for the loss of conductivity. This relation is qualitatively confirmed by studying streamers in N2–O2 mixtures with less oxygen than air. In such mixtures, steady streamers require lower background fields, due to a reduction in the attachment and recombination rates. We also study the deceleration of streamers, which is important to predict how far they can propagate in a low field. Stagnating streamers are simulated by applying a constant applied voltage. We show how the properties of these streamers relate to the steady cases, and present a phenomenological model with fitted coefficients that describes the evolution of the velocity and radius. Finally, we compare the lengths of the stagnated streamers with predictions based on the conventional stability field.},

   abstract = {Several publications have shown that it is challenging to model the stagnation of positive streamers. They find that as the streamers propagate, the space charge region at the streamer tip reduces in size and that the associated electric field increases towards infinity. In a recent study on streamer propagation in unsteady airflow, we circumvented this problem by relaxing the local density and electric field approximation in the drift-diffusion model, commonly used in the past models. The results, recently published, show that the electric field remains bounded during the streamer propagation. In the present paper, we explore the process of stagnation further with a more rigorous approach. We confirm that the instability in the electric field is an immediate effect of the local density and field approximation and that an extended description of ionization stabilizes the electric field and leads to a decelerating streamer. Finally, we discuss the role of positive ions in the stagnation and we show that the stagnating streamer velocity decreases till it becomes comparable to the ion velocities in the streamer head. This causes a broadening of the streamer head which leads to a sharp decrease in the streamer tip electric field and the streamer stagnation.},

   abstract = {The electrical breakdown of synthetic air under ultrashort high-voltage pulses (50 ns duration), as well as slowly increasing (“DC”) voltages, is experimentally studied in a well-defined quasi-uniform electrode configuration (sphere–plane). The electrode spacing is varied from 0.1 to 1 mm, and the gas pressure is varied from 1.5 to 8 bar. The study’s goal is to provide experimental data to develop breakdown models that predict the breakdown probability of small gas gaps under arbitrary voltage excitations. In particular, this analysis is intended for applications where statistical and formative time lags need to be considered, such as nanosecond pulsed ignition or partial discharges in inverter-fed motors. The influence of the electrode material and the presence of UV illumination are investigated for both DC and pulsed voltages. The results highlight the important role of seed electron provision for breakdown under short transient voltages. Evidence for a field-assisted emission of seed electrons with a pressure-dependent onset field is found from time lag measurements. An empirical expression is derived based on the Fowler–Nordheim formula to quantify the seed electron generation rate. The expected dependence of the breakdown threshold on the cathode material (work function) was confirmed for breakdown under slowly increasing voltages (Townsend mechanism). Interestingly, a dependence of the breakdown voltage was also found for nanosecond pulsed voltages (dominated by the streamer mechanism). This suggests that the field emission of electrons from the cathode is the dominant source of seed electrons in large cathode electric fields.},

It is found that Q = 104 gives a fair fit to experimental results for both wires and points, and for positive and negative corona, for radii varying from 0.01 to 20 cm. By assuming a linear variation of α′ with the difference of the electric field from the critical field where ionization equals attachment, an analytic formula can be derived for the breakdown field for the onset of corona as a function of the radius of the sphere, which is similar to, but different from, Peek's formula for the onset of corona for cylinders or wires. The formulae also give the breakdown field as a function of temperature and pressure. For Townsend and Streamer breakdown mechanisms, values of Q are typically 3 × 104 and 108, respectively. Thus the value Q derived from experimental values of the onset field for corona for both wires and points is significantly lower than would be expected from either the Townsend breakdown criterion or the Streamer breakdown criterion. It is suggested that the most likely collision process to explain the observed low value of Q is indirect ionization, for example by collisions between excited molecules.},

The mechanisms active in air at higher pressures, viz., the electron avalanche and its tip field, photo-ionization in the gas and positive streamer formation are presented. A quantitative criterion for streamer formation is applied to give a quantitative theory for spark breakdown in air at atmospheric pressures. The theory gives quantitative agreement with experiment and predicts departures from Paschen's law. At values of the product, pressure times gap length less than 200 mm×cm in air, the new mechanism is unimportant. The theory is applied to longer sparks at atmospheric pressures and the effect of the decrease in density of photo-ionization in longer avalanches considered. This leads to a modification of the Meek mechanism by which the electron avalanche slows down while a retrograde positive streamer moves at high speed to the cathode and then advances again. This mechanism enables one to discuss the breakdown potentials of unsymmetrical gaps showing the difference in sparking potential between positive and negative points. The mechanism is correlated with the passage of lightning discharges. Alterations of Meek's theory of the stepped leader are indicated. Part I describes the classical theory of spark discharge and the nature of the mechanism which must be active at higher pressures.

   abstract = {The breakdown of a uniform field is considered to occur by the transition of an electron avalanche proceeding from cathode to anode into a self-propagating streamer, which develops from anode to cathode to form a conducting filament between the electrodes. A criterion is put forward for such a transition, viz., a streamer will develop when the radial field about the positive space charge in an electron avalanche attains a value of the order of the external applied field. For then photoelectrons in the immediate vicinity of the avalanche will be drawn into the stem of the avalanche and will give rise to a conducting filament of plasma, and a self-propagating streamer proceeds towards the cathode. The theory thus depends on ionization by electrons and photo-ionization in the gas and dispenses with the classical assumption of ionization by positive ions in the gas or secondary actions at the cathode. On this basis an equation for breakdown is developed, and reference to αp-Xp curves enables the potential required for breakdown to be determined. Satisfactory agreement between calculation and experiment is found in air for values of pressure times gap length down to pδ∼100 mm Hg×cm. The theory does not conform absolutely to Paschen's law, but the deviations are within the present day margins of experimental error. For lower values of pδ the deviation between calculation and experiment is explained by the fact that the density of photo-ionization becomes small, and the secondary mechanism, γ, is observed in this region, so that classical theory applies. The theory is indicated to be consistent with all the requirements so far established in connection with sparks for large pδ up to the lightning discharge. © 1940 The American Physical Society.},

We study discharge inception in 500 mbar synthetic air by applying 10 ms long 17 kV pulses with a repetition frequency of 2 Hz to a pin-to-plate electrode geometry with a gap length of 6 cm. We record inception times for hundreds of pulses by measuring the time delay between the rising edge of the high-voltage (HV) pulse and the signal from a photo-multiplier tube. Three characteristic time scales for inception are observed: (1) 20 ns, (2) 25 <italic>μ</italic> s, and (3) 125 <italic>μ</italic> s. To investigate the underlying processes, we apply a low-voltage (LV) pulse in between the HV pulses. These LV pulses can speed up or delay discharge inception, and our results suggest that the three time scales correspond to: (1) free electrons or electron detachment from negative ions close to the electrode, (2) a process that liberates electrons from (quasi)-neutrals, and (3) the drift of an elevated density of negative ions to the ionization zone. However, each of these explanations has its caveats, which we discuss. We present a theoretical analysis of the distribution of inception times, and perform particle simulations in the experimental discharge geometry. Some of the observed phenomena can be explained by these approaches, but a surprizing number of open questions remain. </p>},

We could estimate PDIV under different waveforms of applied surge voltage for different specifications of enameled wires.

We simulate positive streamer discharges that propagate towards a dielectric surface, attach to it, and then propagate over the surface. The simulations are performed in air with a two-dimensional plasma fluid model, in which a flat dielectric is placed between two plate electrodes. Electrostatic attraction is the main mechanism that causes streamers to grow towards the dielectric. Due to the net charge in the streamer head, the dielectric gets polarized, and the electric field between the streamer and the dielectric is increased. Compared to streamers in bulk gas, surface streamers have a smaller radius, a higher electric field, a higher electron density, and higher propagation velocity. A higher applied voltage leads to faster inception and faster propagation of the surface discharge. A higher dielectric permittivity leads to more rapid attachment of the streamer to the surface and a thinner surface streamer. Secondary emission coefficients are shown to play a modest role, which is due to relatively strong photoionization in air. In the simulations, a high electric field is present between the positive streamers and the dielectric surface. We show that the magnitude and decay of this field are affected by the positive ion mobility.},

Also, arrested streamers stop closer to the high voltage electrode when a profiled surface is used.

As a result, the peak electric field at the streamer head and the streamer velocity are higher for positive voltage polarity. The average electric field in the negative streamer channel is approximately twice that in the positive streamer channel, in agreement with available measurements in long air gaps.

In this paper, we present a new particle-in- cell (PIC) method for solving this system that is 4th-order accurate in both space and time. Our method is a high-order extension of one presented previously [B. Wang, G. H. Miller, and P. Colella, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 33 (2011), pp. 3509-3537]. It treats all of the stages of the standard PIC update|charge deposition, force interpolation, the field solve, and the particle push|with 4th-order accuracy, and includes a 6th-order accurate phase-space remapping step for controlling particle noise. We demonstrate the convergence of our method on a series of one- and two- dimensional electrostatic plasma test problems, comparing its accuracy to that of a 2nd-order method. As expected, the 4th- order method can achieve accuracy comparable to that of the 2nd-order method and with considerably fewer resolution elements.},

Building macroscopic models for these filaments is one approach to attain a deeper knowledge of the discharge corona. Here, we present a one-dimensional, macroscopic model of a propagating streamer channel with a finite and evolving internal conductivity. We represent the streamer as an advancing finite-conductivity channel with a surface charge density at its boundary. This charge evolves self-consistently due to the electric current that flows through the streamer body and within a thin layer at its surface. We couple this electrodynamic evolution with a field-dependent set of chemical reactions that determine the internal channel conductivity. With this one-dimensional model, we investigate the formation of persisting structures in the wake of a streamer head. In accordance with experimental observations, our model shows that a within a streamer channel some regions are driven towards high fields that can be maintaned for tens of nanoseconds.},

Most of these models are inhibitively complex to use for modelling many-streamer interactions in a streamer corona. This work develops reduced order models of single positive streamers in atmospheric pressure air that replicate the core macroscopic behaviour of detailed models while using a simpler physics representation. Models are developed using the 1.5D framework, with emphasis placed on solving the equations of motion in the streamer reference frame. The solution in this quasi-steady frame is shown to be a good representation of the instantaneous state of the streamer. Finally, a method of uniquely characterizing the instantaneous state of a streamer using its macroscopic parameters (velocity, radius, tip electric field and channel electric field) is developed. This characterization is interpreted graphically, with streamers treated as quasi-steady structures which evolve in time at a rate much slower than the time scale of electron transport. Previous work in the literature is shown to be well captured by this interpretation.},

   abstract = {In this review we describe a transient type of gas discharge which is commonly called a streamer discharge, as well as a few related phenomena in pulsed discharges. Streamers are propagating ionization fronts with self-organized field enhancement at their tips that can appear in gases at (or close to) atmospheric pressure. They are the precursors of other discharges like sparks and lightning, but they also occur in for example corona reactors or plasma jets which are used for a variety of plasma chemical purposes. When enough space is available, streamers can also form at much lower pressures, like in the case of sprite discharges high up in the atmosphere. We explain the structure and basic underlying physics of streamer discharges, and how they scale with gas density. We discuss the chemistry and applications of streamers, and describe their two main stages in detail: inception and propagation. We also look at some other topics, like interaction with flow and heat, related pulsed discharges, and electron runaway and high energy radiation. Finally, we discuss streamer simulations and diagnostics in quite some detail. This review is written with two purposes in mind: First, we describe recent results on the physics of streamer discharges, with a focus on the work performed in our groups. We also describe recent developments in diagnostics and simulations of streamers. Second, we provide background information on the above-mentioned aspects of streamers. This review can therefore be used as a tutorial by researchers starting to work in the field of streamer physics.},

   abstract = {A theory is presented for the development of the first streamer when a positive voltage is abruptly applied to a point in air at atmospheric pressure. The continuity equations for electrons, positive ions and negative ions, including the effects of ionization, attachment, recombination, electron diffusion, and photoionization, are solved simultaneously with Poisson's equation. With an applied voltage of 20 kV across a 50 mm gap, the streamer does not reach the cathode. An intense electric field front propagates away from the point into the gap to a distance of 35 mm in 200 ns. During the next 7.5 μs the streamer only moves a further 2 mm into the gap, and the electric field at the head of the streamer collapses. Finally, only positive space charge remains which moves away from the point, allowing the field near the point to recover after ∼10 μs; free electrons can thus give rise to a secondary discharge near the anode. The electric field distribution is shown to be quite different from that found previously for SF6 in that the electric field in the column of the streamer is generally only a fraction of the critical field for which ionization equals attachment. Streamers for a given applied voltage have a far greater range in air than in SF6. The results presented for air also apply to flue gas mixtures, since the important material properties of both gases are very similar.},

More thermal runaways are produced if the ionization due to natural background and photoionization is reduced, due to possibility of creation of higher electric fields at streamer tips. The test-particle simulation shows, however, that these thermal runaway electrons have insufficient energies to become relativistic runaways. The simulations are done in constant uniform background fields of E0=4 and 6 MV/m. A simulation was also performed in E0=2 MV/m after formation of streamers in 4-MV/m field, in order to approximate the average background field created by ∼1-MV voltage over a ∼1-m electrode gap used in laboratory spark experiments. We conclude that the used fluid model is insufficient to explain X-ray observations during such experiments.

Two recent papers have shown how that unacceptable occurrence can be avoided by replacing the Poisson random variables with binomial random variables, whose values are naturally bounded. This paper describes a modified Poisson tau-leaping procedure that also avoids negative populations, but is easier to implement than the binomial procedure. The new Poisson procedure also introduces a second control parameter, whose value essentially dials the procedure from the original Poisson tau-leaping at one extreme to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm at the other; therefore, the modified Poisson procedure will generally be more accurate than the original Poisson procedure. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

First, we propose a new second-order semi-implicit scheme for the temporal discretization of the model that relaxes the dielectric relaxation time restriction. Moreover, it requires solving the Poisson-type equation only once at each time step, while the classical second-order explicit schemes typically need to do twice. Second, we introduce a geometric multigrid preconditioned FGMRES solver that dramatically improves the efficiency of solving the Poisson-type equation with either constant or variable coefficients. We show numerically that no more than 4 iterations are required for the Poisson solver to converge to a relative residual of 10−8 during streamer simulations; the FGMRES solver is much faster than R&B SOR and other Krylov subspace solvers. Last but not least, all the methods are implemented using MPI. The parallel efficiency of the code and the fast algorithmic performances are demonstrated by a series of numerical experiments using up to 2560 cores on the Tianhe2-JK clusters.

In the limit that the lattice spacing approaches zero, in two or more dimensions, the RDME has been shown to lose bimolecular reactions. The RDME is therefore not a convergent approximation to any spatially continuous model that incorporates bimolecular reactions. In this work we derive a new convergent RDME (CRDME) by finite volume discretization of a spatially continuous stochastic reaction-diffusion model popularized by Doi. We demonstrate the numerical convergence of reaction time statistics associated with the CRDME. For sufficiently large lattice spacings or slow bimolecular reaction rates, we also show that the reaction time statistics of the CRDME may be approximated by those from the RDME.

In the RDME, space is partitioned by a mesh into a collection of voxels. There is an unanswered question as to how solutions depend on the mesh spacing. To have confidence in using the RDME to draw conclusions about biological systems, we would like to know that it approximates a reasonable physical model for appropriately chosen mesh spacings. This issue is investigated by studying the dependence on mesh spacing of solutions to the RDME in R 3 for the bimolecular reaction A + B - Ø, with one molecule of species A and one molecule of species B present initially. We prove that in the continuum limit the molecules never react and simply diffuse relative to each other. Nevertheless, we show that the RDME with nonzero lattice spacing yields an asymptotic approximation to a specific spatially continuous diffusion limited reaction (SCDLR) model. We demonstrate that for realistic biological parameters it is possible to find mesh spacings such that the relative error between asymptotic approximations to the solutions of the RDME and the SCDLR models is less than one percent.© 2009 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

   abstract = {The generation of x- and gamma-rays in atmospheric discharges has been studied intensively since the discovery of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) by the Compton gamma-ray Observatory in 1991. Emissions are bremsstrahlung from high energy particles accelerated in large scale atmospheric electric fields associated with thunderstorms. Whereas observations now are many, both from lightning and the laboratory, the phases of the discharge where emissions are generated are still debated and several processes for electron acceleration have been put forward by theorists. This paper address the electron acceleration in streamer region of lightning. We present the first 'beam-bulk' model of self-consistent streamer dynamics and electron acceleration. The model combines a Monte Carlo Collision code that simulates the high-energy electrons (>100 eV) and a fluid code that simulates the bulk of the low-energy electrons and ions. For a negative streamer discharge, we show how electrons are accelerated in the large electric field in the tip of the streamer and travel ahead of the streamer where they ionize the gas. In comparison to the results obtained with a classical fluid model for a negative streamer, the beambulk model predicts a decrease of the magnitude of the peak electric field and an increase of the streamer velocity. Furthermore, we show that a significant number of runaway electrons is lost by diffusion outside of the streamer tip. The results presented here do not yet include extra amplification nor acceleration far away from the streamer to explain the electron energies seen in TGFs. Still, in the light of those results, we emphasize that the production of runaway electrons from streamers needs to be simulated including the self-consistent feedback of runaways on the streamer. Simulations with a beam-bulk model may not only help to understand the fundamental atmospheric processes behind TGFs, but also pave the way for the interpretation of remote sensing of the most energetic discharges in the Earth's atmosphere and thus help to address their environmental impact. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Simulations using the proposed method are compared with a naive mesoscopic approach, microscopic simulations that track every molecule, and analytical results that are exact in 1D and an approximation in 3D.

The impacts of plasma chemistry on fuel oxidation pathways at low temperature conditions, substantially enhancing ignition and flame stabilization, are analyzed base on the ignition and extinction S-curve. Secondly, plasma assisted low temperature ignition, direct ignition to flame transition, diffusion cool flames, and premixed cool flames are demonstrated experimentally by using dimethyl ether and n-heptane as fuels. The results show that non-equilibrium plasma is an effective way to accelerate low temperature ignition and fuel oxidation, thus enabling the establishment of stable cool flames at atmospheric pressure. Finally, the experiments from both a non-equilibrium plasma reactor and a photolysis reactor are discussed, in which the direct measurements of intermediate species during the low temperature oxidations of methane/methanol and ethylene are performed, allowing the investigation of modified kinetic pathways by plasma-combustion chemistry interactions. Finally, the validity of kinetic mechanisms for plasma assisted low temperature combustion is investigated. Technical challenges for future research in plasma assisted low temperature combustion are then summarized.},

   abstract = {Plasma assisted combustion is a promising technology to improve engine performance, increase lean burn flame stability, reduce emissions, and enhance low temperature fuel oxidation and processing. Over the last decade, significant progress has been made towards the applications of plasma in engines and the understanding of the fundamental chemistry and dynamic processes in plasma assisted combustion via the synergetic efforts in advanced diagnostics, combustion chemistry, flame theory, and kinetic modeling. New observations of plasma assisted ignition enhancement, ultra-lean combustion, cool flames, flameless combustion, and controllability of plasma discharge have been reported. Advances are made in the understanding of non-thermal and thermal enhancement effects, kinetic pathways of atomic O production, diagnostics of electronically and vibrationally excited species, plasma assisted combustion kinetics of sub-explosion limit ignition, plasma assisted low temperature combustion, flame regime transition of the classical ignition S-curve, dynamics of the minimum ignition energy, and the transport effect by non-equilibrium plasma discharge. These findings and advances have provided new opportunities in the development of efficient plasma discharges for practical applications and predictive, validated kinetic models and modeling tools for plasma assisted combustion at low temperature and high pressure conditions. This article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the progress and the gap in the knowledge of plasma assisted combustion in applications, chemistry, ignition and flame dynamics, experimental methods, diagnostics, kinetic modeling, and discharge control.},

   abstract = {The paper reviews recent progress in two rapidly developing engineering applications of plasmas, plasma assisted combustion and plasma assisted high-speed flow control. Experimental and kinetic modeling results demonstrate the key role of non-thermal plasma chemistry in hydrocarbon ignition by uniform, repetitively pulsed, nanosecond pulse duration, low-temperature plasmas. Ignition delay time in premixed ethylene-air flows excited by the plasma has been measured in a wide range of pulse repetition rates and equivalence ratios and compared with kinetic modeling calculations, showing good agreement. Comparing ignition delay time predicted by the model for plasma assisted ignition and for ignition by equilibrium heating demonstrated that chain reactions of radicals generated by the plasma reduce ignition time by up to two orders of magnitude and ignition temperature by up to 300 K. These results provide additional evidence of the non-thermal nature of low-temperature plasma assisted ignition. Experiments and flow modeling show that the dominant mechanism of high-speed plasma flow control is thermal, due to heating of the flow by the plasma. Development and characterization of pulsed dc and pulsed RF localized arc filament plasma actuator arrays for control of high-speed atmospheric pressure jet flows are discussed. Actuator power is quite low, ∼10 W at 10% duty cycle. Plasma emission spectra show that a greater fraction of the pulsed RF discharge power goes to heat the flow (up to 2500 °C), while a significant fraction of the pulsed dc discharge power is spent on electrode and wall heating, resulting in their erosion. Rapid localized heating of the flow by the pulsed arc filaments, at a rate of ∼1000 K/10 νs, results in the formation of strong compression/shock waves, detected by schlieren imaging. Effect of flow forcing by repetitively pulsed RF actuators is demonstrated in a M = 1.3 axisymmetric jet. These two case studies provide illustrative examples of isolating non-thermal (non-equilibrium plasma chemistry) and thermal (Joule heating) effects in plasmas and adapting them to develop efficient large-volume plasma igniters and high-speed flow actuators. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {There are several mechanisms that affect a gas when using discharge plasma to initiate combustion or to stabilize a flame. There are two thermal mechanisms-the homogeneous and inhomogeneous heating of the gas due to 'hot' atom thermalization and vibrational and electronic energy relaxation. The homogeneous heating causes the acceleration of the chemical reactions. The inhomogeneous heating generates flow perturbations, which promote increased turbulence and mixing. Non-thermal mechanisms include the ionic wind effect (the momentum transfer from an electric field to the gas due to the space charge), ion and electron drift (which can lead to additional fluxes of active radicals in the gradient flows in the electric field) and the excitation, dissociation and ionization of the gas by e-impact, which leads to non-equilibrium radical production and changes the kinetic mechanisms of ignition and combustion. These mechanisms, either together or separately, can provide additional combustion control which is necessary for ultra-lean flames, high-speed flows, cold low-pressure conditions of high-altitude gas turbine engine relight, detonation initiation in pulsed detonation engines and distributed ignition control in homogeneous charge-compression ignition engines, among others. Despite the lack of knowledge in mechanism details, non-equilibrium plasma demonstrates great potential for controlling ultra-lean, ultra-fast, low-temperature flames and is extremely promising technology for a very wide range of applications.},

We will study the relativistic runaway electron avalanche (RREA) and the relativistic feedback process, as well as the production of bremsstrahlung photons from runaway electrons. The Monte Carlo simulations take into account the effects of electron ionization, electron by electron (Møller), and electron by positron (Bhabha) scattering as well as the bremsstrahlung process and pair production, in the 250 eV to 100 GeV energy range. Our results indicate that the multiplication of electrons during the development of RREAs and under the influence of feedback are consistent with previous estimates. This is important to validate GEANT4 as a tool to model RREAs and feedback in homogeneous electric fields. We also determine the ratio of bremsstrahlung photons to energetic electrons Nγ/Ne. We then show that the ratio has a dependence on the electric field, which can be expressed by the avalanche time τ(E) and the bremsstrahlung coefficient α(). In addition, we present comparisons of GEANT4 simulations performed with a "standard" and a "low-energy" physics list both validated in the 1 keV to 100 GeV energy range. This comparison shows that the choice of physics list used in GEANT4 simulations has a significant effect on the results.},

   abstract = {Cold electron runaway means that free electrons in gases are accelerated by electric fields from eV energies to energies above tens of keV where they can be accelerated further. To run away, the electrons need to overcome a barrier at intermediate energies where they can lose much energy in collisions. When they have reached the runaway regime, they can produce high-energy radiation by bremsstrahlung that can be detected as (terrestrial) gamma ray flashes. When can thermal electrons from active discharges like streamers and leaders reach the runaway regime? The deterministic approach to this question is based on an energy-dependent electron friction that has to be overcome by electric acceleration. Taking the stochastic nature of the electron molecule collisions into account, we find (1) that the classical friction curve in the energy regime up to 1 keV does not characterize the mean electron energy, but rather, it seems to approximate the upper limit of the electron energy distribution and (2) that electrons can “tunnel” through the barrier when the field is close to 3 MV/m, below the so-called cold runaway threshold (or critical field) of approximately 26 MV/m in air at standard temperature and pressure. (3) This is only true in the bulk perspective where the electron liberation and attachment in a given electric field is taken into account in the continuously refreshing electron ensemble. In a flux simulation that follows individual electrons as long as they are free, electron attachment reduces electron runaway very strongly in air, differently to what we observe in nitrogen.},

Using detailed Monte Carlo calculations, properties of relativistic feedback are investigated.

These emissions appear over wide timescales, ranging from sub-microsecond bursts of x-rays associated with lightning leaders, to sub-millisecond bursts of gamma-rays seen in space called terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, to minute long glows from thunderclouds seen on the ground and in or near the cloud by aircraft and balloons. In particular, terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs), which are thought to be emitted by thunderclouds, are so bright that they sometimes saturate detectors on spacecraft hundreds of kilometers away. These TGFs also generate energetic secondary electrons and positrons that are detected by spacecraft in the inner magnetosphere. It is generally believed that these x-ray and gamma-ray emissions are generated, via bremsstrahlung, by energetic runaway electrons that are accelerated by electric fields in the atmosphere.

After the occurrence of an LMA source with a high peak power (26 kW), the initial lightning evolution caused an unusually large IC current moment that became detectable 2 ms after the first LMA source and increased for another 2 ms, during which the burst of gamma-rays was produced. This slowly building current moment was most likely associated with the upward leader progression, which produced an uncommonly large IC charge moment change (+90 Ckm) in 3 ms while being punctuated by a sequence of fast discharge. These observations suggest that the leader development may be involved in the TGF production. Copyright © 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

During its stepping, the leader tip is accompanied by a corona consisting of multitudinous streamers perturbing the air in its vicinity and leaving residual charge behind. We explore the relative importance of air perturbations and preionization on the production of energetic runaway electrons by 2.5D cylindrical Monte Carlo particle simulations of streamers in ambient fields of 16 and 50 kV cm-1 at ground. We explore preionization levels between 1010 and 1013 m-3, channel widths between 0.5 and 1.5 times the original streamer widths and air perturbation levels between 0% and 50% of ambient air. We observe that streamers in preionized and perturbed air accelerate more efficiently than in non-ionized and uniform air with air perturbation dominating the streamer acceleration. We find that in unperturbed air and in fields above breakdown strength preionization levels of 1011 m-3 are sufficient to explain significant runaway electron rates. In perturbed air, the production rate of runaway electrons varies from 1010 to 1017 s-1 with maximum electron energies from some hundreds of eV up to some hundreds of keV in fields above and below the breakdown strength with only a marginal effect of the channel radius. Conclusively, the complexity of the streamer zone ahead of leader tips allows explaining the emission of energetic electrons and photons from streamer discharges in fields below and above the breakdown magnitudes.},

We incorporate TGF observations and the key physics behind current TGF production theories with lightning physics to produce constraints on TGF production mechanisms. The combined constraints naturally suggest a mechanism for TGF production by current pulses in lightning leader channels. The mechanism involves local field enhancements due to charge redistribution in current pulses and draws seed energetic particles from cold runaway in breakdown processes. The mechanism can reproduce the observed TGF time scale including multipulse TGFs, is in agreement with existing production altitude estimates, and may help explain TGF spectra by naturally producing unbeamed emissions.

   abstract = {X-ray and γ-ray emissions, observed in correlation with negative leaders of lightning and long sparks of high-voltage laboratory experiments, are conventionally connected with the bremsstrahlung of high-energy runaway electrons (REs). Here we extend a focusing mechanism, analyzed in our previous paper, which allows the electric field to reach magnitudes, required for a generation of significant RE fluxes and associated bremsstrahlung, when the ionization wave propagates in a narrow, ionized channel created by a previous streamer. Under such conditions we compute the production rate of REs per unit streamer length as a function of the streamer velocity and predict that, once a streamer is formed with the electric field capable of producing REs ahead of the streamer front, the ionization induced by the REs is capable of creating an ionized channel that allows for self-sustained propagation of the RE-emitting ionization wave independent of the initial electron concentration. Thus, the streamer coronas of the leaders are probable sources of REs producing the observed high-energy radiation. To prove these predictions, new simulations are planned, which would show explicitly that the preionization in front of the channel via REs will lead to the ionization wave propagation self-consistent with RE generation.},

   abstract = {The source of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) has remained a mystery since their discovery in 1994. Recent Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) observations show that these intense bursts of MeV gamma rays likely originate much deeper in the atmosphere than previously inferred from Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) data, with the source altitude <21 km. Using existing measurements of the intensity and duration of BATSE and RHESSI TGFs, along with limits on the electric field set by the relativistic feedback mechanism involving backward propagating positrons and x-rays, it is found that TGFs cannot be produced by relativistic runaway electron avalanches acting on natural background radiation or extensive cosmic-ray air showers alone, as has been assumed by many previous models. Instead, the energetic seed particle production most likely involves either relativistic feedback or runaway electron production in the strong electric fields associated with lightning lead or streamers, similar to the energetic radiation observed on the ground from lightning.

The X rays were produced in discrete, intense bursts emitted in coincidence with the formation of the leader steps, demonstrating unambiguously that the source of lightning X rays is closely related to the stepping process. The X-ray emission from lightning stepped leaders is found to be remarkably similar to that from lightning dart leaders, suggesting that these different types of leaders share a common mechanism.

   abstract = {In the present paper, we demonstrate that the exponential expansion of streamers propagating in fields higher than the critical fields for stable propagation of streamers of a given polarity leads to the exponential growth of electric potential differences in streamer heads. These electric potential differences are directly related to the energy that thermal runaway electrons can gain once created. Using full energy range relativistic Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the exponential growth of potential differences in streamers gives rise to the production of runaway electrons with energies as high as ∼100 keV, with most of electrons residing in energy range around several tens of keVs. We apply these concepts in the case of lightning stepped leaders during the stage of negative corona flash. The computation of electric field produced by stepped leaders demonstrates for the first time that those energetic electrons are capable of further acceleration up to the MeV energies. Moreover, the flux of runaway electrons produced by streamers suggests that stepped leaders produce a considerable number of energetic electrons, which is in agreement with the number of energetic photons observed from satellites in terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs). The results suggest that previously proposed process of relativistic runaway electron avalanche is difficult to sustain in the low-electric fields observed in thunderclouds and is generally not needed for explanation of TGFs. The present work also gives insights on relations between physical properties of energetic electrons produced in streamers and the internal electrical properties of streamer discharges, which can further help development and interpretation of X-ray diagnostics of these discharges.

Even the most basic questions of how lightning is initiated inside thunderclouds and how it then propagates for many tens of kilometers have only begun to be addressed. In the past, progress was hampered by the unpredictable and transient nature of lightning and the difficulties in making direct measurements inside thunderstorms, but advances in instrumentation, remote sensing methods, and rocket-triggered lightning experiments are now providing new insights into the physics of lightning. Furthermore, the recent discoveries of intense bursts of X-rays and gamma-rays associated with thunderstorms and lightning illustrate that new and interesting physics is still being discovered in our atmosphere. The study of lightning and related phenomena involves the synthesis of many branches of physics, from atmospheric physics to plasma physics to quantum electrodynamics, and provides a plethora of challenging unsolved problems.

The experimental setup was designed to search for electrons produced in meter-scale sparks using a 1 MV Marx generator. Negative voltage was applied to the high voltage (HV) electrode. Five thin (1 mm) plastic detectors (5 cm2 each) were distributed in various configurations close to the spark gap. Earlier studies have shown (for HV negative) that X-rays are produced when a cloud of streamers is developed 30–60 cm from the negative electrode. This indicates that the electrons producing the X-rays are also accelerated at this location, that could be in the strong electric field from counterstreamers of opposite polarity. Comparing our measurements with modeling results, we find that ∼300 keV electrons produced about 30–60 cm from the negative electrode are the most likely source of our measurements. A statistical analysis of expected detection of photon bursts by these fiber detectors indicates that only 20%–45% of the detected bursts could be from soft (∼10 keV) photons, which further supports that the majority of detected bursts are produced by relativistic electrons.},

We model electron and photon dynamics in space and energy with a Monte Carlo model. Also the detector response to incoming photons is modelled in detail.

Our calculations show that for example in an 80 cm long rod-sphere air gap at atmospheric pressure with negative lightning impulse breakdown voltage of about 925 kV, electrons are accelerated to values in the range of 100-300 keV during the encounter. Subsequently, these electrons gain more energy moving through the potential gradient of the positive streamer region. The total gain of energy by electrons may reach 300-500 keV. The results also show that negative discharges can produce more energetic electrons than positive.

The consistent timing of the bursts with the high-voltage surge excluded background radiation as the source for the high intensity pulses. In spite of the symmetry of the gap, negative surges produced more intense radiation than positive. This has been attributed to additional positive discharges from the measurement cabinet which occurred for negative surges. Some hard radiation signals were equivalent to several megaelectronvolts.

It is found here that shorter rise times and high peak voltages tend to produce more X-rays emissions with higher energies than longer front waveforms or lower peak voltages. In a similar way, higher voltage variations produce more energetic emissions. This finding suggests that the variation of the electric field before the breakdown can play a fundamental role in the X-ray production.

They are bremsstrahlung from energetic electrons interacting with neutral air molecules, but it is still unclear how the electrons achieve the required energies. It has been proposed that the enhanced electric field of streamers, found in the corona of leader tips, may account for the acceleration; however, their efficiency is questioned because of the relatively low production rate found in simulations. Here we emphasize that streamers usually are simulated with the assumption of homogeneous gas, which may not be the case on the small temporal and spatial scales of discharges. Since the streamer properties strongly depend on the reduced electric field E/n, where n is the neutral number density, fluctuations may potentially have a significant effect. To explore what might be expected if the assumption of homogeneity is relaxed, we conducted simple numerical experiments based on simulations of streamers in a neutral gas with a radial gradient in the neutral density, assumed to be created, for instance, by a previous spark. We also studied the effects of background electron density from previous discharges. We find that X-radiation and γ-radiation are enhanced when the on-axis air density is reduced by more than ∼25%. Pre-ionization tends to reduce the streamer field and thereby the production rate of high-energy electrons; however, the reduction is modest. The simulations suggest that fluctuations in the neutral densities, on the temporal and spacial scales of streamers, may be important for electron acceleration and bremsstrahlung radiation.},

Using a plasma fluid approach, we model head-on collisions between negative and positive streamers. We observe the occurrence of a very strong electric field at the location of the streamer collision. However, the enhancement of the field produces a strong increase in the electron density, which leads to a collapse of the field over only a few picoseconds. Using a Monte Carlo model, we have verified that this process is therefore not responsible for the acceleration of a significant number of electrons to energy >1keV. We conclude that no significant X-ray emission could be produced by the head-on encounter of nonthermal streamer discharges. Moreover, we quantify the optical emissions produced in the streamer collision.

Recent simulations using plasma fluid and particle in cell models of a single head-on collision of two streamers of opposite polarities in ground pressure air predicted an insignificant number of thermal runaway electrons '1 keV and hence weak undetectable X-ray emissions. Because the current available models of a single streamer collision failed to explain the observations, we first use a Monte Carlo model coupled with multiple static dielectric ellipsoids immersed in a subbreakdown ambient electric field as a description of multiple streamer environment and we investigate the ability of multiple streamer-streamer head-on collisions to accelerate runaway electrons '1 keV up to energies ∼200–300 keV instead of just one single head-on collision. The results of simulations show that the streamer head-on collision mechanism fails to accelerate electrons; instead, they decelerate in the positive streamer channel. In a second part, we use a streamer plasma fluid model to simulate a new streamer-electron acceleration mechanism based on a collision of a large negative streamer with a small neutral plasma patch in different Laplacian electric fields |E0|= (35, 40, 45) kV/cm, respectively. We observe the formation of a secondary short propagating negative streamer with a strong peak electric field '250 up to 378 kV/cm over a time duration of ∼0.16 ns at the moment of the collision. The mechanism produces up to 106 runaway electrons with an upper energy limit of 24 keV.},

   abstract = {High-voltage laboratory experiments show that discharges in air, generated over a gap of one meter with maximal voltage of 1 MV, may produce X-rays with photon energies up to 1 MeV. It has been suggested that the photons are bremsstrahlung from electrons accelerated by the impulsive, enhanced field during collisions of negative and a positive streamers. To explore this process, we have conducted the first self-consistent particle simulations of streamer encounters. Our simulation model is a 2-D, cylindrically symmetric, particle-in-cell code tracing the electron dynamics and solving the space charge fields, with a Monte Carlo scheme accounting for collisions and ionization. We present the electron density, the electric field, and the velocity distribution as functions of space and time. Assuming a background electric field 1.5 times the breakdown field, we find that the electron density reaches 2·1021 m−3, the size of the encounter region is ∼3·10−12 m3 and that the field enhances to ∼9 times the breakdown field during ∼10−11 s. We further find that the radial component becomes comparable to the parallel component, which together with angular scattering leads to an almost isotropic distribution of electrons. This is consistent with laboratory observations that X-rays are emitted isotropically. However, the maximum energy of electrons reached in the simulation is ∼600 eV, which is well below the energies required to explain observations. The reason is that the encounter region is small in size and duration. For the photon energies observed, the field must be enhanced in a larger region and/or for a longer time.},

   abstract = {The evolution of negative streamers during electric breakdown of a non-attaching gas can be described by a two-fluid model for electrons and positive ions. It consists of continuity equations for the charged particles including drift, diffusion and reaction in the local electric field, coupled to the Poisson equation for the electric potential. The model generates field enhancement and steep propagating ionization fronts at the tip of growing ionized filaments. An adaptive grid refinement method for the simulation of these structures is presented. It uses finite volume spatial discretizations and explicit time stepping, which allows the decoupling of the grids for the continuity equations from those for the Poisson equation. Standard refinement methods in which the refinement criterion is based on local error monitors fail due to the pulled character of the streamer front that propagates into a linearly unstable state. We present a refinement method which deals with all these features. Tests on one-dimensional streamer fronts as well as on three-dimensional streamers with cylindrical symmetry (hence effectively 2D for numerical purposes) are carried out successfully. Results on fine grids are presented, they show that such an adaptive grid method is needed to capture the streamer characteristics well. This refinement strategy enables us to adequately compute negative streamers in pure gases in the parameter regime where a physical instability appears: branching streamers. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Streamers are ionization waves in electric discharges. One of the key ingredients of streamer propagation is an ambient gas that serves as a source of free electrons. Here, we explore the dependence of streamer dynamics on different spatial distributions of ambient air molecules. We vary the spatial profile of air parallel and perpendicular to the ambient electric field. We consider local sinusoidal perturbations of 5%-100%, as induced from discharge shock waves. We use a cylindrically symmetric particle-in-cell code to simulate the evolution of bidirectional streamers and compare the electron density, electric field, streamer velocity and electron energy of streamers in uniform air and in perturbed air. In all considered cases, the motion is driven along in decreasing air density and damped along increasing air density. Perturbations of at most 5%-10% change the velocity differences by up to approximately 40%. Perturbations perpendicular to the electric field additionally squeeze or branch streamers. Air variations can thus partly explain the difference of velocities and morphologies of streamer discharges. In cases with large perturbations, electrons gain energies of up to 30 keV compared to 100 eV in uniformly distributed air. For such perturbations parallel to the ambient electric field, we see the spontaneous initiation of a negative streamer; for perpendicular perturbations, x-rays with energies of up to 20 keV are emitted within 0.17 ns.},

   abstract = {Streamer behaviour near dielectric surfaces is an important characteristic of air-solid electrical insulation systems. Accurate predictions are important for dielectric design, but dynamic aspects such as surface charging during streamer propagation are not well understood. A drift-diffusion model is used here to simulate positive streamer behaviour in non-uniform fields. The 2D-planar simulation domain includes air gaps between a tip of a HV electrode and a dielectric barrier laying on a grounded plane. The resulting surface charge distributions approach saturation charge conditions, i.e. zero normal electric field on the air side of the boundary. Such charging behaviour was also reported in lightning impulse (LI) experiments. The simulations are also aligned with empirical streamer propagation range estimates. It is demonstrated that saturation charge levels are reachable within a few tens of nanoseconds of exposure to positive streamer channels. Ion drift is shown to be the dominating mechanism of surface charging during positive streamer propagation, although photoemission also plays an important role. Discharge suppression by streamer-deposited surface charge is also demonstrated. Furthermore, the influence of back discharges at the LI tail on the surface charge distribution is shown. Simulating realistic streamer surface charging behaviour with arbitrary electrode and dielectric shapes is an important step toward first principles discharge prediction models.},

In July and August 2004, sprites were observed from Langmuir Laboratory, in the mountains of New Mexico, using a >1000 frames-per-second intensified CCD imager mounted to a Dobsonian reflecting telescope. We present a number of examples of sprite features, along with photometric data on sprites and sprite halos, taken with the Wide-angle Array for Sprite Photometry (WASP). Results show a variety of structures, including evidence of formation and evolution of both streamers and beads. Examples and statistics presented indicate that most bead structures have sizes of 10-300 m, similar to previous telescopic observations, and endure typically for a few milliseconds to 10 ms, with rare cases of up to 50 ms. Similarly, streamer-like structures are observed to have diameters of 10-300 m but persist for shorter timescales, typically 2-3 ms, with occasional cases of up to 10 ms. Attempts to measure propagation of streamers indicate that higher frame rates are required in order to observe speeds on the order of previous wide-field-of-view observations and modeling predictions.

Sprites can be large with horizontal widths of more than 40 km and can extend from the clouds up to the lower ionosphere thus affecting a large volume of the atmosphere.

Simultaneously, a brighter column expands upward and downward from the initiation point. This expansion is usually followed by the development of bright upward propagating streamers that originate from the bottom of the expanding bright column and that terminate in diffuse emissions. The lower portions of these upward streamers are typically brighter and more persistent and form the bright core of the sprite. A new phenomenon is observed in which the tips of downward-moving sprite streamers are attracted to and, in some cases, collide with adjacent streamer channels. The points of streamer collision appear to become long-persisting sprite beads, which have been suggested previously to affect mesospheric chemistry.

We then show that the properties of beads and glows, including this synchronized decay, are explained by the tendency of electric current within a streamer channel to converge to an uniform value and by an attachment instability of electric discharges in air.

For each pressure p, we find a minimal diameter dmin. To test whether streamers at different pressures are similar, the minimal streamer diameter dmin is multiplied by its pressure p; we find this product to be well approximated by p dmin = 0.20 0.02 mm bar over two decades of air pressure at room temperature. The value also fits diameters of sprite discharges above thunderclouds at an altitude of 80 km when extrapolated to room temperature (as air density rather than pressure determines the physical behaviour).

For the hemispherical electrode 2 cm in diameter the diameters vary in the range 1.6-6.3 mm when the streamer length is 2-16 cm. The streamers are thicker when the electrode diameter is doubled from 2 to 4 cm. There is a downward trend in the streamer diameter with the propagation of the streamer heads. Their diameters for higher voltage decline at a lower rate. A modified analytical model is also employed to explain the observations. The streamer head potential and the maximum electric field are analysed for long streamers of tens of centimetres. The model can predict the value of the streamer diameter for different streamer head positions during its propagation. The experimental data and the calculated results are in good agreement. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

X-rays were measured 0-80 μs just prior to and at the beginning of 73% of the 26 return strokes observed. The emission was composed of multiple, very brief bursts of x-rays in the 30-250 keV range, with each burst typically lasting less than 1 μs. The x-rays were primarily observed to be spatially and temporally associated with the dart leaders with a possible contribution from the beginning of the return strokes, with the most intense x-ray bursts coming from the part of the lightning channel within ∼50 m of the ground. Because triggered lightning strokes are similar to subsequent strokes in natural lightning, it is likely that x-ray emission is a common property of natural lightning.

All 14 discharges generated x-rays in the ∼30 to 150 keV range. The x-rays, which arrived in discrete bursts, less than 0.5 microseconds in duration, occurred from both positive and negative polarity rod-to-plane discharges as well as from small, 5-10 cm series spark gaps within the Marx generator. The x-ray bursts usually occurred when either the voltages across the gaps were the largest or were in the process of collapsing.

   abstract = {In this paper we estimate the probability that cold electrons can be accelerated by an ambient electric field into the runaway regime, and discuss the implications for negative streamer formation. The study is motivated by the discovery of ms duration bursts of γ-rays from the atmosphere above thunderstorms, the so-called Terrestrial Gamma-Ray Flashes. The radiation is thought to be bremsstrahlung from energetic (MeV) electrons accelerated in a thunderstorm discharge. The observation goes against conventional wisdom that discharges in air are carried by electrons with energies below a few tens of eV. Instead the relativistic runaway electron discharge has been proposed which requires a lower threshold electric field; however, seed electrons must be born with energies in the runaway regime. In this work we study the fundamental problem of electron acceleration in a conventional discharge and the conditions on the electric field for the acceleration of electrons into the runaway regime. We use particle codes to describe the process of stochastic acceleration and introduce a novel technique that improves the statistics of the relatively few electrons that reach high energies. The calculation of probabilities for electrons to reach energies in the runaway regime shows that even with modest fields, electrons can be energized in negative streamer tips into the runaway regime, creating a beamed distribution in front of the streamer that affects its propagation. The results reported here suggest that theories of negative streamers and spark propagation should be reexamined with an improved characterization of the kinetic effects of electrons.

When utilized in a 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) model with radiation transport, the MG solver is demonstrated to reduce the required simulation time by approximately a factor of three over a conventional Jacobi scheme. Next, a fully theoretical photoionization model, based on the basic properties of N2 and O2 molecules is developed as an alternative to widely utilized semi-empirical models. Following a review of N2 emission properties, a total of eight transitions from only three excited states are reported as a base set of transitions for a practical physics-based photoionization model.

Then we implement and solve the simplest model for positive streamers in ambient air with self-consistent charge transport. We demonstrate that charge conservation contradicts the common assumption of dielectric breakdown models that the electric fields inside all streamers are equal to the so-called stability field and we even find cases of local field inversion. We also find that, counter-intuitively, the inner branches of a positive-streamer tree are negatively charged, which provides a natural explanation for the observed reconnections of streamers in laboratory experiments and in sprites. Our simulations show the structure of an overall 'streamer of streamers' that we name collective streamer front, and predict effective streamer branching angles, the charge structure within streamer trees and streamer reconnection. © 2014 IOP Publishing and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

   abstract = {3D simulations have been performed on the streamer branching process for a quasi-uniform electric field configuration. The propagation of the individual streamer branches is simulated by a series of electrostatic calculations and a physical and deterministic criterion is used for the streamer branching. The step length assigned to each branch is proportional to the electric field magnitude in the space around the tip, which in effect makes the step length a measure of the local speed on each filament. The simulations have been focused on positive streamer discharges propagating in air and in air along a dielectric surface. In the case when the streamer propagates in air, we have investigated the effect of the background field, the streamer radius and the branching angle. It was only possible to simulate a few branching steps due to high demand on required computer power and memory. Still, several interesting features were deduced from the simulations using the accomplished steps. It was observed that the multiplication process was intense in the early stage of the streamer development. In the later stage, when the streamer passed the high field region, the existing branches continued as separate almost straight filaments. In the case when the background field was increased, the branching was found to be substantially higher. Also, in this case the length of the individual filaments was significantly longer which indicates that the streamer speed was increased. Concerning the streamer radius, we found that an increasing streamer diameter will inhibit the branching process. The streamer propagated for some distance in the gap as a single filament and then started to multiply. Finally, when a dielectric surface was introduced parallel to the electrode gap, we could observe a distinguished preference direction taken by the individual branches. Some of them were attracted to the surface and had a more pronounced multiplication. This indicates that the field enhancement caused by the dielectric constant can be a considerable factor when a streamer propagates along an insulator surface. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The propagation and branching of pulsed positive corona streamers in a short gap is observed with high resolution in space and time. The appearance of the pre-breakdown phenomena can be controlled by the electrode configuration, the gas composition and the impedance of the pulsed power circuit. In a point-wire gap the positive corona shows much more branching than in the parallel plane gap with a protrusion. In air, the branching is more pronounced than in argon. The pulsed power circuit appears to operate in two modes, either as an inductive circuit creating a lower number of thick streamers or as a resistive circuit giving a higher number of thin streamers. A possible cause for branching is electrostatic repulsion of two parts of the streamer head. The electric field at the streamer head is limited, the maximum values found are ∼170 kV cm-1 in air and ∼100 kV cm-1 in argon. At these maximum field strengths, the electrons have 5-10 eV energy, so the ionization is dominated by two-step processes. Differences between argon and ambient air in the field strength at which streamers propagate are ascribed to the difference in de-excitation processes in noble and molecular gases. The fact that the pulsed power circuit can control the streamer structure is important for applications, but this effect must also be taken into account in fundamental studies of streamer propagation and branching.},

   abstract = {A general framework for photoionization rate calculations in a constant pressure gaseous medium is introduced. The formulation includes the number of photons emitted per unit volume per unit time per unit wavelength due to a radiating source, photobasorption cross sections and density of species comprising the medium, and the photoionization probability (i.e. photoionization yield) of the species being photoionized. We derive a standard integral representation of the photoionization problem that may be readily converted to a set of Helmholtz differential equations for efficient calculation of the photoionization rate. The model is applied to the photoionization problem in air in which b1Πu, b′1Σu+, c31Πu, o31Πu, c4′1Σu+ singlet states of N2 are excited due to collisions with electrons generated as a result of nonthermal discharges. Radiative decay from these states gives rise to respective band systems Birge-Hopfield I, Birge-Hopfield II, Worley-Jenkins, Worley, and Carroll-Yoshino, and to photons which are generally energetic enough to ionize O2. The excitation rates and contribution of each band system to photoionization of O2 in air are calculated for the first time. Using recently measured electron impact excitation cross sections of these states, and the recently measured extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectra of N2, we quantify the emission from each singlet state. Absorption of emission is modeled using measured photoabsorption cross sections of N2 and O2. The photoionization rate of O2 upon absorption of a photon with a certain energy is calculated using experimental values for the photoionization yield of O2. Finally, we introduce a set of coefficients which define the differential representation of the problem of photoionization in air. The developed modeling framework allows accurate solution of photoionization problems in air for the broad range 10-2 < pO2 R < 104 Torr cm, where pO2 is the partial pressure of O2 in air in units of Torr (pO2 = 152 Torr at atmospheric pressure) and R in cm is a characteristic spatial dimension of the system of interest. The model performance is demonstrated using a set of artificial sources leading to photoionization over a representative range of pO2 R values and a realistic problem of dynamics of a double-headed streamer in air that was used in previous photoionization literature. The validity of the modeling framework is demonstrated by comparisons with the photo-ion yield function in air, Ψ (pO2 R), derived from the classic photoionization model of Zheleznyak et al (1982) and more recent experimental data on photoionization in air.},

We discuss the spatial and temporal discretization methods, and show that the resulting overall method is second order convergent, monotone, and conservative (for smooth solutions). Weak scalability with parallel efficiencies over 70% are demonstrated up to 8192 cores and more than one billion cells.

The LLNS equations incorporate thermal fluctuations into macroscopic hydrodynamics by the addition of whitenoise fluxes whose magnitudes are set by a fluctuation-dissipation relation. Originally derived for equilibrium fluctuations, the LLNS equations have also been shown to be accurate for nonequilibrium systems. Previous studies of numerical methods for the LLNS equations focused primarily on measuring variances and correlations computed at equilibrium and for selected nonequilibrium flows. In this paper, we introduce a more systematic approach based on studying discrete equilibrium structure factors for a broad class of explicit linear finite-volume schemes. This new approach provides a better characterization of the accuracy of a spatiotemporal discretization as a function of wavenumber and frequency, allowing us to distinguish between behavior at long wavelengths, where accuracy is a prime concern, and short wavelengths, where stability concerns are of greater importance. We use this analysis to develop a specialized third-order Runge-Kutta scheme that minimizes the temporal integration error in the discrete structure factor at long wavelengths for the one-dimensional linearized LLNS equations. Together with a novel method for discretizing the stochastic stress tensor in dimension larger than one, our improved temporal integrator yields a scheme for the three-dimensional equations that satisfies a discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance for small time steps and is also sufficiently accurate even for time steps close to the stability limit.},

In particular, numerical solutions should approximate the Gibbs-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution, and ideally this will hold even for large time step sizes. We describe finite-volume spatial discretizations for the fluctuating Burgers and fluctuating incompressible Navier-Stokes equations that obey a discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance principle just like the continuum equations. We develop implicit-explicit predictor-corrector temporal integrators for the resulting stochastic method-of-lines discretization. These stochastic Runge-Kutta schemes treat diffusion implicitly and advection explicitly, are weakly second-order accurate for additive noise for small time steps, and give a good approximation to the equilibrium distribution even for very strong fluctuations. Numerical results demonstrate that a midpoint predictor-corrector scheme is very robust over a broad range of time step sizes. © 2013 American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {There are two formalisms for mathematically describing the time behavior of a spatially homogeneous chemical system: The deterministic approach regards the time evolution as a continuous, wholly predictable process which is governed by a set of coupled, ordinary differential equations (the "reaction-rate equations"); the stochastic approach regards the time evolution as a kind of random-walk process which is governed by a single differential-difference equation (the "master equation"). Fairly simple kinetic theory arguments show that the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics has a firmer physical basis than the deterministic formulation, but unfortunately the stochastic master equation is often mathematically intractable. There is, however, a way to make exact numerical calculations within the framework of the stochastic formulation without having to deal with the master equation directly. It is a relatively simple digital computer algorithm which uses a rigorously derived Monte Carlo procedure to numerically simulate the time evolution of the given chemical system. Like the master equation, this "stochastic simulation algorithm" correctly accounts for the inherent fluctuations and correlations that are necessarily ignored in the deterministic formulation. In addition, unlike most procedures for numerically solving the deterministic reaction-rate equations, this algorithm never approximates infinitesimal time increments dt by finite time steps Δt. The feasibility and utility of the simulation algorithm are demonstrated by applying it to several well-known model chemical systems, including the Lotka model, the Brusselator, and the Oregonator.},

   abstract = {Photoionization plays an important role in the mechanism of positive streamer discharges in air. The photoelectron production rate at high pressures is significantly overestimated in the widely used quantitative photoionization model in nitrogen-oxygen mixtures. A new photoionization model is proposed to surmount this disadvantage approximately by tracking the generation and deactivation of high excited states of N2. Implementation, validation, and discussion of the new photoionization model are presented in this paper. The photoionization coefficient, the fraction of nitrogen ionization events that leads to oxygen photoionization events without quenching, is computed in the new model. It decreases with the increasing pressure when E/p is constant, which agrees with the early experimental results and corrects the overestimation of the photoionization coefficients at high pressures to some extent. Simulations of positive streamers show that the generation and deactivation of high excited states of N2 weaken the discharge of nitrogen and enhance the nonlocal discharge of oxygen with a time delay in the new model. The time delay slows down the positive streamer discharges in our simulations.},

   abstract = {A particle code has been developed to study the distribution and acceleration of electrons in electric discharges in air. The code can follow the evolution of a discharge from the initial stage of a single free electron in a background electric field to the formation of an electron avalanche and its transition into a streamer. The code is in 2D axi-symmetric coordinates, allowing quasi 3D simulations during the initial stages of streamer formation. This is important for realistic simulations of problems where space charge fields are essential such as in streamer formation. The charged particles are followed in a Cartesian mesh and the electric field is updated with Poisson's equation from the charged particle densities. Collisional processes between electrons and air molecules are simulated with a Monte Carlo technique, according to cross section probabilities. The code also includes photoionisation processes of air molecules by photons emitted by excited constituents. The paper describes the code and presents some results of streamer development at 70 km altitude in the mesosphere where electrical discharges (sprites) are generated above severe thunderstorms and at ∼10 km relevant for lightning and thundercloud electrification. The code is used to study acceleration of thermal seed electrons in streamers and to understand the conditions under which electrons may reach energies in the runaway regime. This is the first study in air, with a particle model with realistic spatial dependencies of the electrostatic field. It is shown that at 1 atm pressure the electric field must exceed ∼7.5 times the breakdown field to observe runaway electrons in a constant electric field. This value is close to the field where the electric force on an electron equals the maximum frictional force on an electron - found at ∼100 eV. It is also found that this value is reached in a negative streamer tip at 10 km altitude when the background electric field equals ∼3 times the breakdown field. At higher altitudes, the background electric field must be relatively larger to create a similar field in a streamer tip because of increased influence of photoionisation. It is shown that the role of photoionization increases with altitude and the effect is to decrease the space charge fields and increase the streamer propagation velocity. Finally, effects of electrons in the runaway regime on negative streamer dynamics are presented. It is shown the energetic electrons create enhanced ionization in front of negative streamers. The simulations suggest that the thermal runaway mechanism may operate at lower altitudes and be associated with lightning and thundercloud electrification while the mechanism is unlikely to be important in sprite generation at higher altitudes in the mesosphere. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Charge conservation creates a negative charge and a consecutively enhanced electric field in the upper section of the streamer channel, while the head carries a growing positive charge. The high electric field in the upper part of the channel generates a secondary ionization wave and a luminous trail. The negative charging explains the emergence of upward, negative streamers from a channel and the attraction of positive heads to a previously formed channel. Finally we show that the vertical gradient in the air density initially accelerates the streamer head and subsequently slows it down, in agreement with recent observations.},

First, double-headed streamers in homogeneous electric fields of 50 kV cm-1 are briefly studied, and then we analyse streamers that emerge from needle electrodes with voltages of 10-20 kV in more detail. The streamer velocity at a given streamer length depends only weakly on the initial ionization seed, except in the case of negative streamers in homogeneous fields. We characterize the streamer evolution by length, velocity, head radius, head charge and maximal field enhancement. We show that the velocity of positive streamers is determined mainly by their radius and in quantitative agreement with recent experimental results both for radius and velocity. The velocity of negative streamers is dominated by electron drift in the enhanced field; in the low local fields of the present simulations, it is little influenced by photo-ionization. Initially it is puzzling that negative streamers can be slower than positive ones under similar conditions, both in experiment and in simulation, as negative streamer fronts always move at least with the electron drift velocity in the local field. We argue that this drift motion broadens the streamer head, decreases the field enhancement and ultimately leads to slower propagation or even extinction of the negative streamer. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

We simulate positive streamers between two planar electrodes with a 3D plasma fluid model, using both a stochastic and a continuum method for photoionization. With stochastic photoionization, fluctuations are visible in the streamer's direction, maximal electric field, velocity, and electron density. The streamers do not branch, and we find good agreement between the averaged stochastic results and the results with continuum photoionization. The streamers stay roughly axisymmetric, and we show that results obtained with an axisymmetric model indeed agree well with the 3D results. However, we find that positive streamers are sensitive to the amount of photoionization. When the amount of photoionization is doubled, there is even better agreement between the stochastic and continuum results, but with half the amount of photoionization, stochastic fluctuations become more important and streamer branching starts to occur.},

   abstract = {The branching and change in direction of propagation (path-deviation) of positive streamers in molecular gases such as air likely require a statistical process which perturbs the head of the streamer and produces an asymmetry in its space charge density. In this paper, the mechanisms for path-deviation and branching of atmospheric pressure positive streamer discharges in dry air are numerically investigated from the viewpoint of statistical photon transport and photoionization. A statistical photon transport model, based on randomly selected emitting angles and mean-free-path for absorption, was developed and embedded into a fluid-based plasma transport model. The hybrid model was applied to simulations of positive streamer coaxial discharges in dry air at atmospheric pressure. The results show that secondary streamers, often spatially isolated, are triggered by the random photoionization and interact with the thin space charge layer (SCL) of the primary streamer. This interaction may be partly responsible for path-deviation and streamer branching. The general process consists of random remote photo-electron production which initiates a back-traveling electron avalanche, collision of this secondary avalanche with the primary streamer and the subsequent perturbation to its SCL. When the SCL is deformed from a symmetric to an asymmetric shape, the streamer can experience an abrupt change in the direction of propagation. If the SCL is sufficiently perturbed and essentially broken, local maxima in the SCL can develop into new streamers, leading to streamer branching. During the propagation of positive streamers, this mechanism can take place repetitively in time and space, thus producing multi-level branching and more than two branches within one level.},

   abstract = {We develop numerical methods for stochastic reaction-diffusion systems based on approaches used for fluctuating hydrodynamics (FHD). For hydrodynamic systems, the FHD formulation is formally described by stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). In the reaction-diffusion systems we consider, our model becomes similar to the reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) description when our SPDEs are spatially discretized and reactions are modeled as a source term having Poisson fluctuations. However, unlike the RDME, which becomes prohibitively expensive for an increasing number of molecules, our FHD-based description naturally extends from the regime where fluctuations are strong, i.e., each mesoscopic cell has few (reactive) molecules, to regimes with moderate or weak fluctuations, and ultimately to the deterministic limit. By treating diffusion implicitly, we avoid the severe restriction on time step size that limits all methods based on explicit treatments of diffusion and construct numerical methods that are more efficient than RDME methods, without compromising accuracy. Guided by an analysis of the accuracy of the distribution of steady-state fluctuations for the linearized reaction-diffusion model, we construct several two-stage (predictor-corrector) schemes, where diffusion is treated using a stochastic Crank-Nicolson method, and reactions are handled by the stochastic simulation algorithm of Gillespie or a weakly second-order tau leaping method. We find that an implicit midpoint tau leaping scheme attains second-order weak accuracy in the linearized setting and gives an accurate and stable structure factor for a time step size of an order of magnitude larger than the hopping time scale of diffusing molecules. We study the numerical accuracy of our methods for the Schlögl reaction-diffusion model both in and out of thermodynamic equilibrium. We demonstrate and quantify the importance of thermodynamic fluctuations to the formation of a two-dimensional Turing-like pattern and examine the effect of fluctuations on three-dimensional chemical front propagation. By comparing stochastic simulations to deterministic reaction-diffusion simulations, we show that fluctuations accelerate pattern formation in spatially homogeneous systems and lead to a qualitatively different disordered pattern behind a traveling wave.},

   abstract = {The simulation of cold plasma discharges is a leading field of applied sciences with many applications ranging from pollutant control to surface treatment. Many of these applications call for the development of novel numerical techniques to implement fully three-dimensional corona solvers that can utilize complex and physically detailed chemical databases. This is a challenging task since it multiplies the difficulties inherent to a three-dimensional approach by the complexity of databases comprising tens of chemical species and hundreds of reactions. In this paper a novel approach, capable of reducing significantly the computational burden, is developed. The proposed method is based on a proper time stepping algorithm capable of decomposing the original problem into simpler ones: each of them has then been tackled with either finite element, finite volume or ordinary differential equations solvers. This last solver deals with the chemical model and its efficient implementation is one of the main contributions of this work.},

   abstract = {This paper concerns a class of deferred correction methods recently developed for initial value ordinary differential equations; such methods are based on a Picard integral form of the correction equation. These methods divide a given timestep [t n ,t n+1] into substeps, and use function values computed at these substeps to approximate the Picard integral by means of a numerical quadrature. The main purpose of this paper is to present a detailed analysis of the implications of the location of quadrature nodes on the accuracy and stability of the overall method. Comparisons between Gauss-Legendre, Gauss-Lobatto, Gauss-Radau, and uniformly spaced points are presented. Also, for a given set of quadrature nodes, quadrature rules may be formulated that include or exclude function values computed at the left-hand endpoint t n . Quadrature rules that do not depend on the left-hand endpoint (which are referred to as right-hand quadrature rules) are shown to lead to L(α)-stable implicit methods with α≈π/2. The semi-implicit analog of this property is also discussed. Numerical results suggest that the use of uniform quadrature nodes, as opposed to nodes based on Gaussian quadratures, does not significantly affect the stability or accuracy of these methods for orders less than ten. In contrast, a study of the reduction of order for stiff equations shows that when uniform quadrature nodes are used in conjunction with a right-hand quadrature rule, the form and extent of order-reduction changes considerably. Specifically, a reduction of order to script O sign(ε2) is observed for uniform nodes as opposed to script O sign(εΔt) for non-uniform nodes, where Δt denotes the time step and ε a stiffness parameter such that ε→0 corresponds to the problem becoming increasingly stiff. © Springer 2005.},

   abstract = {As part of a systematic study of approximations commonly made in solutions of the Boltzmann equation for electrons in molecular gases, we have investigated the effects of anisotropic scattering on electron transport coefficients in N2 and have extended our study of the multiterm expansion technique to higher E/n. A critical survey of published data yields a set of differential and integral cross sections for electron energies from 0.003 to 104 eV. For electric-field-to-gas-density ratios E/n between 10 and 500 Td (1 Td=10-21 V m2), the changes in the commonly measured transport and reaction coefficients resulting from the introduction of anisotropic elastic and inelastic scattering, while keeping the elastic momentum-transfer cross section constant, are less than 1%. These calculations were made with use of the multiterm spherical-harmonic expansion solution of the Boltzmann equation. For 500<E/n<1500 Td the changes in scattering anisotropy cause changes in transport and reaction coefficients which increase with E/n to about 10%. The errors in drift velocity, mean energy, and the reaction coefficients resulting from the use of the two-term spherical-harmonic expansion rather than a six-term expansion are less than 3% at 1500 Td. However, the errors in the diffusion coefficients become large (>25%) at our highest E/n. The calculated transport coefficients are in generally good agreement with experiment for E/n less than 300 Td, but the differences increase at higher E/n. The importance of proper interpretation of ionization and excitation experiments at high E/n is illustrated by calculations which model either an exponential growth of density in time or an exponential growth with position. The calculated ionization coefficients are low compared to most experiments for E/n less than 200 Td. At E/n>600 Td the agreement is good for the spatial growth experiments, but the calculated values are below experiment from the temporal growth experiments. The calculated excitation coefficients are generally higher than experiment at low and high E/n but in agreement with experiment at E/n near 150 Td. © 1985 The American Physical Society.},

Such coefficients are usually calculated from collision cross-section data by solving the electron Boltzmann equation (BE). In this paper we present a new user-friendly BE solver developed especially for this purpose, freely available under the name BOLSIG+, which is more general and easier to use than most other BE solvers available. The solver provides steady-state solutions of the BE for electrons in a uniform electric field, using the classical two-term expansion, and is able to account for different growth models, quasi-stationary and oscillating fields, electron-neutral collisions and electron-electron collisions. We show that for the approximations we use, the BE takes the form of a convection-diffusion continuity-equation with a non-local source term in energy space. To solve this equation we use an exponential scheme commonly used for convection-diffusion problems. The calculated electron transport coefficients and rate coefficients are defined so as to ensure maximum consistency with the fluid equations. We discuss how these coefficients are best used in fluid models and illustrate the influence of some essential parameters and approximations. © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The streamers propagate in combustible fuel-air mixtures at high pressures representative of internal combustion engine conditions. The study was performed using a self-consistent, two-temperature plasma model with finite-rate plasma chemical kinetics. Positive high voltage pulses of order tens of kV and duration of tens of nanoseconds were applied to the powered inner cylindrical electrode which resulted in the formation and propagation of a cathode-directed streamer. The resulting spatial and temporal production of active radical species such as O, H, and singlet delta oxygen is quantified and compared for lean and stoichiometric fuel-air mixtures. For the coaxial electrode geometry, the discharge is characterized by a primary streamer that bridges the inter-electrode gap and a secondary streamer that develops in the wake of the primary streamer. Most of the radicals are produced in the secondary streamer. For the corona geometry, only the primary streamer is observed and the radicals are produced throughout the length of the primary streamer column. The stoichiometry of the mixture was observed to have a relatively small effect on both the plasma discharge structure and the resulting yield of radical species. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

The question of how lightning is stimulated is therefore one of the outstanding problems in atmospheric electricity. According to the popular idea first suggested by Loeb and developed further by Phelps, lightning can be initiated fromstreamers developed in the enhanced electric field around hydrometeors. In our paper, we prove by numerical simulations that positive streamers are initiated, specifically, around charged water drops. The simulation model includes the kinetics of free electrons, and positive and negative ions, the electron impact ionization and photon ionization of the neutral atmospheric constituents, and the formation of space charge electric fields. Simulations were conducted at air pressure 0.4 atm, typical at thundercloud altitudes, and at different background electric fields, drop sizes, and charges. We show that the avalanche-to-streamer transition is possible near drops carrying 63-485 pC in thundercloud fields with intensity of 10 kVcm-1atm-1 and 15 kVcm-1atm-1 for drops sizes of 1mmand 0.5mm, respectively. Thus, the electric field required for the streamer formation is larger than the measured thunderstorm fields. Therefore, the results of simulations suggest that second mechanisms must operate to amplify the local field. Such mechanisms could be electric field space variations via collective effects of many hydrometeors or runaway breakdown.},

   abstract = {This paper reports a modeling study on the dynamics of relatively long streamers initiated from an isolated hydrometeor in subbreakdown (0.5Ek) and overbreakdown (1.5Ek) electric fields, respectively, where Ek is the conventional breakdown threshold field. The modeling results indicate that at 0.5Ek field, the streamer shows a generally exponential growth feature, but its channel characteristics such as radius, electron density, and current density exhibit colocated fluctuations. On the other hand, at 1.5Ek field, the streamer shows faster exponential growth, and no fluctuations of those parameters are observed. The exponential growth property allows one to use the modeling results to predict the characteristics of longer streamers, as well as to quantify the thunderstorm electrical conditions including the high-field region size and potential difference in order to accelerate the streamer to the high speed of fast positive breakdown that was observed recently in lightning initiation. At 0.5Ek, a potential difference of ~0.3-1.8 MV is required to accelerate the streamer to the high speed of 1-5 × 107 m/s, while at 1.5Ek, ~0.07-0.4 MV is required. The exponentially growing streamer current produces an exponentially increasing magnetic field, leading to electromagnetic (EM) field radiation. It is found that the growth rate of the magnetic field (1/tBφ) radiated by a streamer can be obtained by a simple relation 1/tBφ ~ 3/t, where 1/t is the growth rate of the streamer. Combining our modeling results with the Fourier analysis reported by Qin et al. (2012), we find that streamers at thundercloud altitudes radiate in the high frequency and very high frequency range of the EM spectrum.},

A particular type of plasma actu- ator that has gained wide use is based on a single–dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) mechanism that has desirable features for use in air at atmospheric pressures. For these actuators, the mechanism of flow control is through a generated body-force vector field that couples with the momentum in the external flow. The body force can be derived from first principles, and the effect of plasma actuators can be easily incorporated into flow solvers so that their placement and operation can be optimized. They have been used in a wide range of internal and external flow applications. Although ini- tially considered useful only at low speeds, plasma actuators are effective in a number of applications at high subsonic, transonic, and supersonic Mach numbers, owing largely to more optimized actuator designs that were de- veloped through better understanding and modeling of the actuator physics. New applications continue to appear through a growing number of pro- grams in the United States, Germany, France, England, the Netherlands, Russia, Australia, Japan, and China.

   abstract = {Electric field values measured inside thunderclouds have consistently been reported to be up to an order of magnitude lower than the value required for the conventional electrical breakdown of air. This result has made it difficult to explain how lightning frequently occurs in thunderclouds. A few different theories have been offered to explain the lightning initiation process, one of them being the theory of lightning initiation from hydrometeors. According to this theory, lightning can be initiated from electrical discharges originating around thundercloud water or ice particles in the measured thundercloud electric field. These particles, called hydrometeors, are believed to cause significant enhancement of the thundercloud electric field in their vicinity and then initiate streamers that are the precursor discharges for the hot lightning leader channel. Previously, Liu et al. (2012a) reported streamer formation from a model hydrometeor in an electric field value of half of the conventional breakdown threshold (Ek) for air. In this paper, we present modeling results for streamer formation in electric fields as low as one third of the breakdown threshold. According to our results, initiation of stable streamers from thundercloud hydrometeors in a 0.3Ek electric field is possible, only if enhanced ambient ionization levels (e.g., the ionization created by corona discharges around the same or other nearby hydrometeors) are present ahead of the streamer. The magnitude and distribution of this ambient density may be a determining factor on whether the streamer branches, recovers after the prebranching stage, or continues propagating stably. We investigate the streamer branching behavior and characteristics and test a theory that has recently been proposed to explain this phenomenon. We find that the geometry of the streamer head plays an important role in the streamer branching phenomena. The fast radial movement of the maximum streamer head curvature, combined with the slow reduction of the maximum curvature value, eventually leads the streamer head to branching. Finally, we compare our modeling results with laboratory experiments and realistic thundercloud conditions and discuss the implications of this study to lightning initiation and other lightning-related phenomena.},

However, it is the ability of the packing to almost double both the conversion and the energy efficiency simultaneously at certain input parameters that makes it very promising.

   abstract = {Glow discharge at atmospheric pressure using a dielectric barrier discharge can induce fluid flow and operate as an actuator for flow control. In this paper, we simulate the physics of a two-dimensional asymmetric actuator operating in helium gas using a high-fidelity first-principles-based numerical modeling approach to help improve our understanding of the physical mechanisms associated with such actuators. Fundamentally, there are two processes in the two half-cycles of the actuator operation, largely due to the difference in mobility between faster electrons and slower ions, and the geometric configurations of the actuator (insulator and electrodes). The first half-cycle is characterized by the deposition of the slower ion species on the insulator surface while the second half-cycle by the deposition of the electrons at a faster rate. A power-law dependence on the voltage for the resulting force is observed, which indicates that larger force can be generated by increasing the amplitude. Furthermore, one can enhance the effectiveness of the actuator by either increasing the peak value of the periodic force generation or by increasing the asymmetry between the voltage half-cycles or both. Overall, the increase in the lower electrode size, applied voltage, and dielectric constant tends to contribute to the first factor, and the decrease in frequency of applied voltage tends to contribute to the second factor. However, the complex interplay between the above factors determines the actuator performance. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {Plasma packed bed reactors (PBRs) are being investigated for applications ranging from pollution remediation to chemical synthesis, including plasma catalysis. Plasma PBRs typically operate as dielectric barrier discharges where the plasma propagating through the PBR strongly interacts with the dielectric packing media and gas in the interstitial spaces. The nature of plasma propagation through this macroscopically porous-like medium is not well understood. Plasma formation in PBRs is a function of many parameters, including dielectric media composition and surface morphology, dielectric constant, packing fraction, pressure, and the applied voltage waveform. Imaging the plasma propagation through the complex three-dimensional geometry of the packing media and interstitial spaces that make up the PBR is difficult to experimentally execute. In this regard, a two-dimensional PBR composed of dielectric disks was developed to enable optical imaging of plasma formation and propagation. The mode of plasma propagation and the sensitivity of discharge formation to material dielectric constant, applied voltage, and pressure were experimentally and computationally investigated. We found that higher dielectric constants of the packing material produced more intense, localized filamentary micro-discharges between disks. In general, plasma propagation through the PBR at 1 atm is initiated by localized micro-discharges between adjacent dielectric disks, which in turn give rise to surface ionization waves (SIWs) that propagate along the dielectric surface. At pressures below 1 atm, the discharge was more diffuse regardless of the dielectric media, filling the interstitial space instead of forming SIWs.},

   abstract = {An extensive study of CO2 conversion in a non-thermal, barium titanate packed-bed plasma reactor was conducted to investigate the influence of discharge power, gas flow rate and Ar dilution on the CO2 conversion, energy efficiency, identity of products and electrical characteristics of the discharge. The maximum energy efficiency in this study (0.29 mmol kJ-1, i.e. 8.3%) was achieved for a pure CO2 plasma, whereas the maximum CO2 conversion (46%) was obtained in a 20/80 CO2/Ar plasma. The results also showed that the energy efficiency was approximately constant at a given gas composition regardless of the gas flow rates. In addition, ozone (up to 100 ppm) was detected and its formation was affected by the gas flow rate. The electrical characteristics of the plasma in the packed-bed reactor were deduced using a simplified DBD equivalent model. The electrical characterisation showed that dilution with argon decreased the discharge breakdown voltage resulting in a higher mean electron energy and increased electron density enhancing conversion. The results also indicated that using a lower flow rate can increase the charge transferred per half-cycle of the applied voltage to facilitate the electron-induced CO2 dissociation, and this effect is more pronounced upon adding Ar.},

   abstract = {Transient discharges at atmospheric pressures are being applied nowadays in many applications [1]. Typical  configurations are pulsed corona, dielectric barrier and packed bed discharges. The term transient implies here  that the discharge exists only as long as it is propagating. Two ways of propagation can be distinguished:  through a gas or along a dielectric. In this paper the propagation through the gas phase will be considered in a  positive corona. This discharge has been studied for many years in experiments and calculations [1].  Nevertheless many aspects have not been resolved. The transient character and the small dimensions make the  discharges difficult to access by measurements. Therefore parameters like electron density and energy, electric  field strength and radical densities are only estimated up to now. The calculations encounter similar problems.  The discharge has very strong gradients in space and time and most of the rate constants of the processes  involved can only be estimated. At present the state-of-the-art of streamer simulations is a 2-D model in the  hydrodynamic approach.  },

   abstract = {A packed bed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) is widely used for plasma catalysis applications, but the exact plasma characteristics in between the packing beads are far from understood. Therefore, we study here these plasma characteristics by means of fluid modelling and experimental observations using ICCD imaging, for packing materials with different dielectric constants. Our study reveals that a packed bed DBD reactor in dry air at atmospheric pressure may show three types of discharges, i.e. positive restrikes, filamentary microdischarges, which can also be localized between two packing beads, and surface discharges (so-called surface ionization waves). Restrikes between the dielectric surfaces result in the formation of filamentary microdischarges, while surface charging creates electric field components parallel to the dielectric surfaces, leading to the formation of surface discharges. A transition in discharge mode occurs from surface discharges to local filamentary discharges between the packing beads when the dielectric constant of the packing rises from 5 to 1000. This may have implications for the efficiency of plasma catalytic gas treatment, because the catalyst activation may be limited by constraining the discharge to the contact points of the beads. The production of reactive species occurs most in the positive restrikes, the surface discharges and the local microdischarges in between the beads, and is less significant in the longer filamentary microdischarges. The faster streamer propagation and discharge development with higher dielectric constant of the packing beads leads to a faster production of reactive species. This study is of great interest for plasma catalysis, where packing beads with different dielectric constants are often used as supports for the catalytic materials. It allows us to better understand how different packing materials can influence the performance of packed bed plasma reactors for environmental applications.},

   abstract = {Although plasma catalysis is gaining increasing interest for various environmental applications, the underlying mechanisms are still far from understood. For instance, it is not yet clear whether and how plasma streamers can propagate in catalyst pores, and what is the minimum pore size to make this happen. As this is crucial information to ensure good plasma-catalyst interaction, we study here the mechanism of plasma streamer propagation in a catalyst pore, by means of a two-dimensional particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision model, for various pore diameters in the nm-range to μm-range. The so-called Debye length is an important criterion for plasma penetration into catalyst pores, i.e. a plasma streamer can penetrate into pores when their diameter is larger than the Debye length. The Debye length is typically in the order of a few 100 nm up to 1 μm at the conditions under study, depending on electron density and temperature in the plasma streamer. For pores in the range of ∼50 nm, plasma can thus only penetrate to some extent and at very short times, i.e. at the beginning of a micro-discharge, before the actual plasma streamer reaches the catalyst surface and a sheath is formed in front of the surface. We can make plasma streamers penetrate into smaller pores (down to ca. 500 nm at the conditions under study) by increasing the applied voltage, which yields a higher plasma density, and thus reduces the Debye length. Our simulations also reveal that the plasma streamers induce surface charging of the catalyst pore sidewalls, causing discharge enhancement inside the pore, depending on pore diameter and depth.},

   abstract = {In most models of reacting gas dynamics, the characteristic time scales of chemical reactions are much shorter than the hydrodynamic and diffusive time scales, rendering the reaction part of the model equations stiff. Moreover, non-linear forcings may introduce into the solutions sharp gradients or shocks, the robust behavior and correct propagation of which require the use of specialized spatial discretization procedures. This study presents high-order conservative methods for the temporal integration of model equations of reacting flows. By means of a method of lines discretization on the flux difference form of the equations, these methods compute approximations to the cell-averaged or finite-volume solution. The temporal discretization is based on a multi-implicit generalization of spectral deferred correction methods. The advection term is integrated explicitly, and the diffusion and reaction terms are treated implicitly but independently, with the splitting errors reduced via the spectral deferred correction procedure. To reduce computational cost, different time steps may be used to integrate processes with widely-differing time scales. Numerical results show that the conservative nature of the methods allows a robust representation of discontinuities and sharp gradients; the results also demonstrate the expected convergence rates for the methods of orders three, four, and five for smooth problems. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Models for reacting flow are typically based on advection-diffusion-reaction (A-D-R) partial differential equations. Many practical cases correspond to situations where the relevant time scales associated with each of the three sub-processes can be widely different, leading to disparate time-step requirements for robust and accurate time-integration. in particular, interesting regimes in combustion correspond to systems in which diffusion and reaction are much faster processes than advection. The numerical strategy introduced in this paper is a general procedure to account for this time-scale disparity. The proposed methods are high-order multi-implicit generalizations of spectral deferred correction methods (MISDC methods), constructed for the temporal integration of A-D-R equations. Spectral deferred correction methods compute a high-order approximation to the solution of a differential equation by using a simple, low-order numerical method to solve a series of correction equations, each of which increases the order of accuracy of the approximation. The key feature of MISDC methods is their flexibility in handling several sub-processes implicitly but independently, while avoiding the splitting errors present in traditional operator-splitting methods and also allowing for different time steps for each process. The stability, accuracy, and efficiency of MISDC methods are first analyzed using a linear model problem and the results are compared to semi-implicit spectral deferred correction methods. Furthermore, numerical tests on simplified reacting flows demonstrate the expected convergence rates for MISDC methods of orders three, four, and five. The gain in efficiency by independently controlling the sub-process time steps is illustrated for nonlinear problems, where reaction and diffusion are much stiffer than advection. Although the paper focuses on this specific time-scales ordering, the generalization to any ordering combination is straightforward. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Our iterative scheme uses a series of relatively simple correction equations to reduce the error in the solution. The new method retains the efficiencies of Strang splitting compared to a traditional method-of-lines approach in that each process is discretised sequentially using a numerical method well suited for its particular time scale. We demonstrate that the overall scheme is second-order accurate and provides increased accuracy with less computational work compared to Strang splitting for terrestrial and astrophysical flames.

The approach results in algorithms of essentially arbitrary order accuracy for both non-stiff and stiff problems; their performance is illustrated with several numerical examples. For non-stiff problems, the stability behavior of the obtained explicit schemes is very satisfactory and algorithms with orders between 8 and 20 should be competitive with the best existing ones.

The high order Piecewise Parabolic Method (PPM) is used for the first time in the case of the streamer dynamic modelling. Its efficiency, in terms of computing time and Absolute Error, is compared with other classical high order numerical schemes already used in streamer modelling as the Superbee Monotone Upstreamcentred Scheme for Conservation Law (MUSCL), the ETBFCT algorithm (Flux Corrected Transport technique) and the Zalesak FCT algorithm including the peak preserver condition. The scheme comparisons and validations are firstly undertaken using a periodic mathematic test (Davies test) having an analytical solution that transports a compressible density square wave in a stationary and oscillating velocity field. The Davies test well reproduces the streamer head behaviour with steep density gradients in sharp velocity field variations. The numerical solutions are analyzed as a function of the period number, the spatial resolution and the Courant-Friedrich-Lewy (CFL) number. In all tested cases, the PPM scheme shows the best efficiency. Then the comparison is performed in the framework of a classical 1.5D streamer model better adapted for the present parametric studies than a cylindrical 2D model.

The high-order tensor in the energy flux equation is approximated by the product of two lower order moments to close the system. The average collision frequencies for momentum and energy transfer in elastic and inelastic collisions for electrons in molecular nitrogen are calculated from a multi-term Boltzmann equation solution. We then discuss, in particular, (1) the correct implementation of transport data in streamer models; (2) the accuracy of the two-term approximation for solving Boltzmann's equation in the context of streamer studies; and (3) the evaluation of the mean-energy-dependent collision rates for electrons required as an input in the high-order fluid model.

As a result, these contact points prove to be of direct importance to initiate the plasma. At low applied potential, the discharge stays at the contact points, and shows the properties of a Townsend discharge. When a high enough potential is applied, the plasma will be able to travel through the gaps in between the beads from wall to wall, forming a kind of glow discharge.

   abstract = {A 3-dimensional particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision simulation that is fully implemented on a graphics processing unit (GPU) is described and used to determine low-temperature plasma characteristics at high reduced electric field, E/n, in nitrogen gas. Details of implementation on the GPU using the NVIDIA Compute Unified Device Architecture framework are discussed with respect to efficient code execution. The software is capable of tracking around 10 × 106 particles with dynamic weighting and a total mesh size larger than 108 cells. Verification of the simulation is performed by comparing the electron energy distribution function and plasma transport parameters to known Boltzmann Equation (BE) solvers. Under the assumption of a uniform electric field and neglecting the build-up of positive ion space charge, the simulation agrees well with the BE solvers. The model is utilized to calculate plasma characteristics of a pulsed, parallel plate discharge. A photoionization model provides the simulation with additional electrons after the initial seeded electron density has drifted towards the anode. Comparison of the performance benefits between the GPU-implementation versus a CPU-implementation is considered, and a speed-up factor of 13 for a 3D relaxation Poisson solver is obtained. Furthermore, a factor 60 speed-up is realized for parallelization of the electron processes.},

   abstract = {Pulsed discharges in high-pressure gases are of considerable interest as sources of nonequilibrium plasma for various technological applications: pollution control, pumping of laser media, plasma-assisted combustion, etc. Recently, attention has been attracted to the use of subnanosecond voltage fronts, producing diffuse discharges with radii of several millimeters. Such plasma structures, similar to pulsed glow discharges, are of special interest for applications due to quasi-uniformity of plasma parameters in relatively large gas volumes. This review presents the results of experimental and computational study of subnanosecond diffuse discharge formation. A description of generators of short high-voltage pulses with subnanosecond fronts and of discharge setups is given. Diagnostic methods for the measurement of various discharge parameters with high temporal and spatial resolution are described. Obtained experimental data on plasma properties for a wide range of governing factors are discussed. A review of various theoretical approaches used for computational study of the dynamics and structure of fast ionization waves is given; the applicability of conventional fluid streamer models for simulation of subnanosecond ionization waves is discussed. Calculated spatial-temporal profiles of plasma parameters during streamer propagation are presented. The efficiency of subnanosecond discharges for the production of reactive species is evaluated. On the basis of the comparison of simulation results and experimental data the effects of various factors (voltage rise time, polarity, etc.) on discharge characteristics are revealed. The major physical phenomena governing the properties of subnanosecond breakdown are analyzed.},

This model, whose source code is available online, is described in the first part of the paper. Then we present simulation results in a needle-to-plane geometry, using different nitrogen/oxygen mixtures at atmospheric pressure. In these mixtures non-local photoionization is important for the discharge growth. The typical length scale for this process depends on the oxygen concentration. With 0.2% oxygen the discharges grow quite irregularly, due to the limited supply of free electrons around them. With 2% or more oxygen the development is much smoother. An almost spherical ionized region can form around the electrode tip, which increases in size with the electrode voltage. Eventually this inception cloud destabilizes into streamer channels. In our simulations, discharge velocities are almost independent of the oxygen concentration. We discuss the physical mechanisms behind these phenomena and compare our simulations with experimental observations.},

   abstract = {A fully resolved kinetic model (particle-in-cell and direct simulation Monte Carlo for particle/photon collisions) of a near atmospheric pressure ionization wave is presented here. Fully resolving the required numerical spatial (sub-μm) and temporal scales (tens of fs) for atmospheric pressure discharges in three-dimensions is still a challenging task on modern super computers. To keep the overall problem tractable, the total number of elements are reduced by only simulating a 10° wedge rather than a full 360° geometry. The ionization wave is generated in a needle-plane configuration with a gap size of 250 μm and a background of nitrogen and helium gas. A voltage of 1500 V is applied to the anode and an initial electron and ion density of 109 cm-3 is seeded in a region near the anode electrode tip and extending towards the cathode. As these initial electrons are swept away, photoionization and photoemission create new electrons and allow the ionization front to propagate towards the cathode. Results from the 90% N2, 10% He discharge indicate that photoionization has minimal impact on plasma formation processes and cathode photoemission is the dominant mechanism for new electrons. In the 90% He, 10% N2 discharge case, however, photoionization likely has an impact as the observed locations of photoionization occur far enough away from the ionization front to allow for sufficient avalanche processes that contribute to the propagation of the ionization wave. Additionally, the electron energy distribution functions in the 90% He, 10% N2 case indicate that there is less energy loss to the low lying molecular N2 electronic states as well as the vibrational and rotational modes. This leads to higher electron energies and faster plasma development times of ∼0.4 ns for the 90% He, 10% N2 case, and ∼1.5 ns for the 90% N2, 10% He case. In addition to analysis of the ionization wave results, the overall challenges associated with simulations near atmospheric pressure discharges in three-dimensions are discussed, including the limitations of the 10° wedge that produces, at least qualitatively, minimal 3D effects.},

First the theoretical basis of Townsend scaling and a list of six possible corrections to scaling are discussed; then the experimental evidence for the similarity between streamers and sprites is reviewed. We then discuss how far present sprite and streamer theory has been developed, and we show how streamer experiments can be interpreted as sprite simulations. We review those results of recent streamer research that are relevant for sprites and other forms of atmospheric electricity and discuss their implications for sprite understanding. These include the large range of streamer diameters and velocities and the overall 3D morphology with branching, interaction and reconnection, the dependence on voltage and polarity, the electron energies in the streamer head and the consecutive chemical efficiency and hard radiation. New theoretical and experimental results concern measurements of streamer spectra in air, the density dependence of streamer heating (hot leaders are unlikely at 80 km altitude and cold streamers are unlikely in liquids), and a discussion of the influence of magnetic fields on thermal electrons or on energetic electrons in streamers or sprites.},

   abstract = {The interaction of plasmas sustained in humid air with liquids produces reactive species in both the gas phase and liquid for applications ranging from medicine to agriculture. In several experiments, enhanced liquid reactivity has been produced when the liquid is a foam or a bubble coated liquid. To investigate the phenomena of streamers interacting with bubbles a two-dimensional computational investigation has been performed of streamer initiation and propagation on and inside hemispherical bubble-shells floating on a liquid surface. Following prior experiments, water and oil bubble-shells with an electrode located outside and inside the bubble were investigated. We found that positive air streamers interact differently with conductive water and dielectric oil bubbles. The streamer propagates along the external surface of a water bubble while not penetrating through the bubble due to screening of the electric field by the conducting shell. If the electrode is inserted inside the bubble, the path of the streamer depends on how deeply the electrode penetrates. For shallow penetration, the streamer propagates along the inner surface of the bubble. Due to the low conductivity of oil bubble-shells, the electric field from an external electrode penetrates into the interior of the bubble. The streamer can then be re-initiated inside the bubble.},

However, scenarios of the streamer discharge interaction with a conductive water bubble and dielectric oil bubble are different in their concrete details.

   abstract = {The branching of electric discharge streamers in atmospheric pressure air, dense gases and liquids is a common occurrence whose origins are likely found with many causes, both deterministic and stochastic. One mechanism for streamer branching may be inhomogeneities in the path of a streamer which either divert the streamer (typically a region of lower ionization) or produce a new branch (a region of higher ionization). The propagation and branching of streamers in liquids is likely aided by low density inhomogeneities, bubbles; however, modeling of streamers in liquids is made difficult by the lack of transport coefficients. As a first step towards understanding the propagation and branching of streamers in liquids, we investigated the consequences of random inhomogeneities in the form of low pressure bubbles on the propagation of streamers in high pressure humid air. By virtue of their lower density, bubbles have larger E/N (electric field/gas number density) than the ambient gas with larger rates of ionization. The intersection of a streamer with a bubble will focus the plasma into the bubble by virtue of that higher rate of ionization but the details of the interaction depend on the relative sizes of the bubble and streamer. When a streamer intersects a field of bubbles, the large E/N in the bubble avalanches seed electrons produced by photoionization from the streamer. Each bubble then launches both a negative and positive going streamer that may link with those from adjacent bubbles or the original streamer. The total process then appears as streamer branching. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The dynamics of streamers intersecting such particles are of interest due to their possible use for functionalizing the surfaces of the particles. Using a 2-dimensional plasma hydrodynamics model having an unstructured mesh, the consequences of dust particles on streamer dynamics were investigated while varying the particle size, shape and material properties. We found that while small dielectric particles (< tens of micrometres) are enveloped by the streamer, larger particles can intercept and reinitiate streamers. By increasing the permittivity and capacitance of the particles, streamer interception and re-initiation may also occur on smaller particles. The presence of multiple particles in the path of a streamer can increase the speed of the avalanche front due to synergistic polarization of the particles. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Four groups use a fully self-implemented code and two make use of COMSOL Multiphysics®. Three test cases are considered, in which axisymmetric positive streamers are simulated in dry air at 1 bar and 300 K in an undervolted gap. All groups use the same fluid model with the same transport coefficients. The first test case includes a relatively high background density of electrons and ions without photoionization. When each group uses their standard grid resolution, results show considerable variation, particularly in the prediction of streamer velocities and maximal electric fields. However, for sufficiently fine grids good agreement is reached between several codes. The second test includes a lower background ionization density, and oscillations in the streamer properties, branching and numerical instabilities are observed. By using a finer grid spacing some groups were able to reach reasonable agreement in their results, without oscillations. The third test case includes photoionization, using both Luque's and Bourdon's Helmholtz approximation. The results agree reasonably well, and the numerical differences appear to be more significant than the type of Helmholtz approximation.

Branchlike patterns of streamers have been observed in anode directed discharges. We explain a mechanism for branching as the result of a balance between the destabilizing effect of impact ionization and the stabilizing effect of electron diffusion on ionization fronts. The dispersion relation for transversal perturbation of a planar negative front is obtained analytically when the ratio D between the electron diffusion coefficient and the intensity of the externally imposed electric field is small. We estimate the spacing λ between streamers and deduce a scaling law λ∼D1/3. © 2005 The American Physical Society.},

Their dynamics are governed by filamentary streamer discharges whose propagation properties have been well studied by past work. However, how they are initiated is still under active debate. It has recently been concluded that ionospheric/mesospheric inhomogeneities are required for their initiation, but it is an open question as to what the sources of those inhomogeneities are. Here we present numerical simulation results to demonstrate that naturally-existing, small-scale mesospheric structures such as those created by gravity waves via instability and breaking are viable sources. The proposed theory is supported by a recent, unique high-speed observation from aircraft flying at 14-km altitude. The theory naturally explains many aspects of observed sprite streamer initiation and has important implications for future observational work.},

   abstract = {Particularly intense lightning discharges can produce transient luminous events above thunderclouds, termed sprites, elves and jets. These short lived optical emissions in the mesosphere can reach from the tops of thunderclouds up to the ionosphere; they provide direct evidence of coupling from the lower atmosphere to the upper atmosphere. Sprites are arguably the most dramatic recent discovery in solar-terrestrial physics. Shortly after the first ground based video recordings of sprites, observations on board the Space Shuttle detected sprites and elves occurring all around the world. These reports led to detailed sprite observations in North America, South America, Australia, Japan, and Europe. Subsequently, sprites were detected from other space platforms such as the International Space Station and the ROCSAT satellite. During the past 15 years, more than 200 contributions on sprites have been published in the scientific literature to document this rapidly evolving new research area. The need for international information exchange was quickly recognized, and sprite sessions became a permanent feature with a constantly growing number of contributions in the scientific communities of the American Geophysical Union (AGU), the International Union of Radio Science (URSI), the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) and the European Geosciences Union (EGU). The idea for a summer school on sprites was born during an informal meet- ing at Tohoku University in 2001, where a number of young scientists gave extended lectures on the details of their scientific work to interested colleagues following an invitation from Yukihiro Takahashi. This experience was felt to be so rewarding that, during the third SPECIAL Scientific Network meeting of the European Science Foundation held in Cambridge, 2002, an organising committee was formed to attract support for a NATO Advanced Study Institute on “Sprites, Elves and Intense Lightning Discharges”. The proposal was ac- cepted byNATOshortly thereafter and the Advanced Study Institute took place at the University of Corsica, in Corte on Corsica, from 24-31 July, 2004. The activity was co-sponsored by the European Science Foundation (ESF), the Re- search Training Network (RTN) “Connecting Atmospheric Layers” (CAL) of the European Commission (EC) and the International Union of Radio Science (URSI). About 80 scientists attended this first summer school on sprites, which was a scientifically excellent, exciting, interactive, and memorable event. The lectures delivered are presented in this book, along with the abstracts of the poster presentations by the young scientists. The book begins with an introduction to the electrical properties of the atmosphere, which sets the scene. Subsequently, the book is organised into four general themes of sprite research. The first theme describes the meteorological conditions for intense lightning discharges which are needed to produce sprites. The second theme describes the experiments for making optical observations of sprites from the ground and space. The third theme deals with radiowaves in the ULF/ELF/VLF frequency range from 3 Hz to 30 kHz, which occur in association with intense lightning discharges and sprites. The book finally wraps up the results within theme four, on theory and modelling in all three experimental areas of sprite research. The Editors thank the lecturers for their strong committment to deliver their scientific knowledge in oral and written from, and also the young scientists for their poster presentations. The Editors also thank Bettina Zapfe for her careful copy-editing of the book and, in particular, for her organisation of the index and the references. The organisers of the summer school express their gratitude to all the sponsors, who helped with substantial travel support. The organisers also thank the University of Corsica for hosting the meeting and Dominique Grandjean for her local support on site. The sprite summer school would not have been so successful without the helping hands of Norma Crosby, Thomas Farges, Ingrid Hörnchen, Tai-Yin Huang, Thomas Ulich, and many others.},

   abstract = {The paper presents the results of temporally and spatially resolved electric field measurements in a nanosecond pulse discharge in atmospheric air, sustained between a razor edge high-voltage electrode and a plane grounded electrode covered by a thin dielectric plate. The electric field is measured by picosecond four-wave mixing in a collinear phase-matching geometry, with time resolution of approximately 2 ns, using an absolute calibration provided by measurements of a known electrostatic electric field. The results demonstrate electric field offset on the discharge center plane before the discharge pulse due to surface charge accumulation on the dielectric from the weaker, opposite polarity pre-pulse. During the discharge pulse, the electric field follows the applied voltage until 'forward' breakdown occurs, after which the field in the plasma is significantly reduced due to charge separation. When the applied voltage is reduced, the field in the plasma reverses direction and increases again, until the weak 'reverse' breakdown occurs, producing a secondary transient reduction in the electric field. After the pulse, the field is gradually reduced on a microsecond time scale, likely due to residual surface charge neutralization by transport of opposite polarity charges from the plasma. Spatially resolved electric field measurements show that the discharge develops as a surface ionization wave. Significant surface charge accumulation on the dielectric surface is detected near the end of the discharge pulse. Spatially resolved measurements of electric field vector components demonstrate that the vertical electric field in the surface ionization wave peaks ahead of the horizontal electric field. Behind the wave, the vertical field remains low, near the detection limit, while the horizontal field is gradually reduced to near the detection limit at the discharge center plane. These results are consistent with time-resolved measurements of electric field components, which also indicate that vertical electric field reverses direction after the ionization wave.},

The present knowledge, based on a widely-accepted concept of critical or stability field introduced half a century ago, indicates the existence of a unique minimum electric field in which streamers could propagate stably with constant radius and velocity. In this work, we present a new understanding indicating that growing, decaying, and stable propagation of streamers is controlled not solely by the external field but also by the physical dimensions of streamers. Stable propagation is demonstrated to be achievable in a wide range of electric fields, with a lower limit of ∼5 kV cm-1for positive streamers and ∼10 kV cm-1for negative streamers in air at atmospheric pressure, up to the breakdown field ∼28.7 kV cm-1. In these field ranges, the streamer radius required for stable propagation is inversely proportional to the external field, with larger and smaller initial radii, respectively, leading to growing and decaying streamers. The new mechanism suggests possible ways to flexibly control the streamer parameters in applications, such as changing the size and potential of the point electrode to obtain the required initial streamer dimensions for the desired propagation pattern.},

@article{Liu2004,
   abstract = {Modeling studies indicate that double-headed streamers originating from single electron avalanches in lightning-driven quasi-static electric fields at mesospheric altitudes accelerate and expand, reaching transverse scales from tens to a few hundreds of meters and propagation speeds up to one tenth of the speed of light, in good agreement with recent telescopic, high-speed video and multichannel photometric observations of sprites. The preionization of the medium ahead of a streamer by the ionizing UV photons originating from a region of high electric field in the streamer head (i.e., photoionization) significantly modifies the streamer scaling properties as a function of air pressure in comparison with those predicted by similarity laws. The photoionization leads to lower peak electric fields in the streamer head, lower streamer electron densities, wider initial streamer structures, and lower acceleration and expansion rates of streamers at sprite altitudes 40-90 km, when compared to the ground level. The primary reason for the observed differences is that the effective quenching altitude of the excited states of the molecular nitrogen b1πu, 6′1Σ u+, and c′41Σ u+ that give photoionizing radiation is about 24 km. The quenching of these states is therefore negligible at sprite altitudes, leading to a substantial enhancement of the electron-ion pair production ahead of the streamer tip because of the photoionization, when compared to the ground level. The maximum radius of the expanding streamers is predominantly controlled by the combination of the absorption cross section χmin = 3.5 × 10-2 cm-1 Torr-1 of the molecular oxygen (O2) at 1025 Å and the partial pressure of O2 in air, po2. Streamers exhibit branching when their radius becomes greater than 1/χmin Po2. Model results indicate a lower branching threshold radius for positive streamers in comparison with negative streamers, under otherwise identical ambient conditions. These results are in good agreement with recent results of high-speed photography of laboratory streamers in near-atmospheric pressure N2/O2 mixtures and similar morphology documented during recent telescopic and high-speed video observations of sprites.

   abstract = {We study pulsed positive discharges in air in a cylindrically symmetric setup with an electrode needle close (about 1 mm) above the top of a dielectric cylindrical rod of 4 mm in diameter mounted at its bottom on a grounded plate electrode. We present ICCD (intensified charge-coupled device) pictures and evaluations of experiments as well as simulations with a fluid discharge model; the simulations use cylindrical symmetry. In the experiments, there is an initial inception cloud phase, where the cylindrical symmetry is maintained, and later a streamer phase, where it is broken spontaneously. At 75-150 mbar, discharges with cylindrical symmetry are not attracted to the dielectric rod, but move away from it. The dielectric rod plays the sole role of an obstacle that shades (in the context of photoionization) a cone-shaped part of the inception cloud; the cone size is determined by the geometry of the setup. The material properties of the dielectric rod, such as its dielectric permittivity and the efficiency of the photon induced secondary electron emission do not have a noticeable effect. This is due to the abundance of photoionization in air, which supplies a positive discharge with free electrons and allows it to propagate along the electric field lines. Using some simple field calculations, we show that field enhancement due to dielectric polarization does not play a significant role in our geometry as long as the discharge maintains its cylindrical symmetry. The field component towards the rod is insufficiently enhanced to cause the discharge to move towards the rod. Any additional electrons produced by the dielectric surface do not influence this discharge morphology. This interpretation is supported by both experiments and simulations. At higher pressures (400-600 mbar) or for larger gaps between the needle and the dielectric rod, the inception cloud reaches its maximal radius within the gap between needle and rod and destabilizes there. In those cases, streamer channels are more likely to turn into a surface streamer. All our experiments and simulations were performed at moderate pressures (75-600 mbar), but we expect that the results will be the same for other pressures assuming that all the lengths scales (including the rod) in the setup are rescaled according to the Townsend scaling of the discharge.},

   abstract = {Two-dimensional numerical simulation of a surface dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) plasma actuator, driven by a nanosecond voltage pulse, is conducted. A special focus is laid upon the influence of grid resolution on the computational result. It is found that the computational result is not very sensitive to the streamwise grid spacing, whereas the wall-normal grid spacing has a critical influence. In particular, the computed propagation velocity changes discontinuously around the wall-normal grid spacing about 2 μm due to a qualitative change of discharge structure. The present result suggests that a computational grid finer than that was used in most of previous studies is required to correctly capture the structure and dynamics of streamer: when a positive nanosecond voltage pulse is applied to the upper electrode, a streamer forms in the vicinity of upper electrode and propagates along the dielectric surface with a maximum propagation velocity of 2 × 108 cm/s, and a gap with low electron and ion density (i.e., plasma sheath) exists between the streamer and dielectric surface. Difference between the results obtained using the finer and the coarser grid is discussed in detail in terms of the electron transport at a position near the surface. When the finer grid is used, the low electron density near the surface is caused by the absence of ionization avalanche: in that region, the electrons generated by ionization is compensated by drift-diffusion flux. In contrast, when the coarser grid is used, underestimated drift-diffusion flux cannot compensate the electrons generated by ionization, and it leads to an incorrect increase of electron density.},

   abstract = {Positive and negative streamers are studied in ambient air at 1 bar; they emerge from a needle electrode placed 40 mm above a planar electrode. The amplitudes of the applied voltage pulses range from 5 to 96 kV; most pulses have rise times of 30 ns or shorter. Diameters, velocities and energies of the streamers are measured. Two regimes are identified; a low voltage regime where only positive streamers appear and a high voltage regime where both positive and negative streamers exist. Below 5 kV, no streamers emerge. In the range from 5 to 40 kV, positive streamers form, while the negative discharges only form a glowing cloud at the electrode tip, but no streamers. For 5-20 kV, diameters and velocities of the positive streamers have the minimal values of d = 0.2 mm and v ≈ 105 m s-1. For 20-40 kV, their diameters increase by a factor of 6 while the voltage increases only by a factor of 2. Above the transition value of 40 kV, streamers of both polarities form; they strongly resemble each other, though the positive ones propagate further; their diameters continue to increase with applied voltage. For 96 kV, positive streamers attain diameters of 3 mm and velocities of 4 × 106 m s-1; negative streamers are about 20% slower and thinner. An empirical fit formula for the relation between velocity v and diameter d is v = 0.5d2 mm-1 ns-1 for both polarities. Streamers of both polarities dissipate energies of the order of several millijoules per streamer while crossing the gap. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Surface discharges created in dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) configurations have been proposed as actuators for flow control in aerodynamic applications. We focus on DBDs operating in a glow regime, i.e., where the discharge is sustained by ion-induced secondary electron emission from the surface and volume ionization. After a brief discussion of the force per unit volume acting on the flow and due to the momentum transfer from charged particles to neutral molecules, we present calculations of this force based on a two-dimensional fluid model of the surface discharge. We show that this force is of the same nature as the electric wind in a corona discharge. However, the force in a DBD is localized in the cathode sheath region of the discharge expanding along the dielectric surface. While its intensity is much larger than the analogous force in a direct-current corona discharge, it is active during less than one hundred nanoseconds for each discharge pulse and the time-averaged forces in the two cases are comparable, at least for the conditions we have chosen for this study. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {Active flow control is a topic in full expansion due to associated industrial applications of huge importance, particularly for aeronautics. Among all flow control methods, such as the use of mechanical flaps, wall synthetic jets or MEMS, plasma-based devices are very promising. The main advantages of such systems are their robustness, simplicity, low power consumption and ability for real-time control at high frequency. This paper is a review of the worldwide works on this topic, from its origin to the present. It is divided into two main parts. The first one is dedicated to the recent knowledge concerning the electric wind induced by surface non-thermal plasma actuators, acting in air at atmospheric pressure. Typically, it can reach 8 m s -1 at a distance of 0.5 mm from the wall. In the second part, works concerning active airflow control by these plasma actuators are presented. Very efficient results have been obtained for low-velocity subsonic airflows (typically U∞ ≤ 30 m s-1 and Reynolds number of a few 105), and promising results at higher velocities indicate that plasma actuators could be used in aeronautics. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {A pulse-energized electron reactor which utilizes pulsed streamer corona has been developed for the combined removal of SO2, NOx, and particles from effluent gases. In the pulse-energized electron reactor process, fast-rising narrow high-voltage pulses are superimposed on a dc-bias voltage and applied to a nonuniform electric field geometry to generate pulsed streamer corona. The pulsed streamer corona produces energetic free electrons, which dissociate gas molecules, forming radicals. These radicals cause chemical reactions that convert SO2 and NOx into acid mists and/or solids, which can be removed from the gas stream by conventional means. The pulsed streamer corona also produces ions, and between pulses the ions charge the fly-ash particles, which are then collected by the dc-bias field. In pulse-energized electron reactor performance tests on a humid air stream with an initial SO2 concentration of 1000 ppm, more than 90 percent of the SO2 was removed with an advantageously small power requirement. Combined treatment performance was demonstrated by introducing high-resistivity fly-ash into the gas stream. The fly-ash collection efficiency of the pulse-energized electron reactor was significantly better than that of a conventional dc wire-cylinder electrostatic precipitator when the electrodes of both were covered with a high-resistivity layer. Most of the fly-ash that escaped collection by the reactor was agglomerated, which facilitates subsequent collection by an electrostatic precipitator or fabric filter. Furthermore, the SO2 removal efficiency was improved by the presence of fly-ash. In addition, some of the SO2 conversion products may lower the resistivity of the fly-ash, thereby facilitating collection in an electrostatic precipitator by reducing back corona. The practical electrode configurations (wire-to-cylinder or wire-to-plate) and performance results of the reactor make it attractive for retrofit applications. © 1989 IEEE},

The effect of these discharges on bacteria was studied using water contaminated with Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis, the latter in both the vegetative and spore state. The strongest effect was obtained on E. coli. The concentration of E. coli could be reduced by three orders of magnitude after applying eight corona discharges to the water. The corresponding energy expenditure is 10 J/cm3. The decontamination rate had the largest values at the beginning, and decreased considerably after 15 electrical discharges, reaching a constant residual concentration value of 10-4 of the initial concentration. For B. subtilis in the vegetative state, it took almost 30 discharges to reach the same result, corresponding to an energy expenditure of 40 J/cm3. There was no effect on B. subtilis spores. Comparisons with the pulsed-electric field (PEF) method indicate that the decontamination efficiency of the PWC method is slightly higher than that of the PEF method.},

Maximum streamer lengths were determined as a function of applied voltage, pulsewidth (decay constant), and water conductivity. The bubbling of gas through the underwater discharge resulted in the disintegration of the gas bubbles, and also caused gas-phase discharges to occur near the nozzle electrode. The production of O3, accomplished by bubbling O2 gas through a discharge in deionized water, was investigated using a colorimetric indigo dye test that measured the concentration of O3 in the water. Chemical reactions occurring when O2 or N2 gas was bubbled through a discharge in an anthraquinone dye solution were studied by photometrically measuring the decolorization of the dye.

   abstract = {The corona-induced simultaneous removal of NO, and SO2 from the flue gas is based on the application of narrow voltage pulses to an electrode structure similar to that of an electrostatic precipitator. The free electrons of the corona discharge, having energy up to 20 eV, originate active radicals which lead to the transformation of NO, and SO2 into their acids which can be neutralized to salt particulate by adding to the gas a basic compound such as ammonia and calcium hydroxide. The process has been investigated with a test rig installed in the slipstream of the flue gas duct of a coal thermal power plant. The experiments were performed with three reactor modules of different geometries having a nominal gas flow rate of 1000 Nm3/h. The voltage pulses, generated with a fast switching experimental device, had a rise front of less than 400 ns and a repetition frequency up to 300 Hz. The test results have confirmed the physical feasibility of the process. Under initial concentrations of NO, and S02 between 400 and 530 ppmV, the removal efficiency was 50–60– for NO, and about 80– for SO2 at an energy input to the gas of 12-14 Wh/Nm3 when ammonia was injected in the flue gas. Using hydrated lime instead resulted in a less suitable basic compound. Further experiments are necessary to assess the effect of different electrode geometries of the reactor, the efficiency of the process attainable with an improved coupling of narrow pulse power set to the reactor, and the practical ways for integrating the DeNOx, and DeSO2 corona process with the solid particle collection system. © 1990 IEEE},

Previous research has demonstrated that a high voltage pulsed electrical discharge directly into water leads to the formation of reactive species such as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. Since significant quantities of hydrogen peroxide are produced, the role of Fenton's reactions in the pulsed corona reactor is analyzed both experimentally and with computer simulations in the present work. Experimental data shows the existence of optimal iron concentrations for the degradation of phenol, and that the formation of hydrogen peroxide by the pulsed corona discharge is dependent upon both the applied electric field and the solution conductivity. A mathematical model based upon mass balances for 31 radical and molecular species in the batch reactor (including 71 chemical reactions) has been developed and sensitivity analysis performed to identify key reactions. This model is used to show the effects of initial reaction conditions (including iron and phenol concentrations) on the degradation of phenol and the formation of reaction intermediate products and by-products. The model results are in qualitative and semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental observations on the effects of initial iron and phenol concentrations on phenol degradation and by-product formation. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The species concentrations and gas temperature are examined in the absence and presence of bulk supersonic flow. The peak gas temperature from the computations is found to be 1180K with the surface plasma alone in the absence of flow and 830Kin the presence of supersonic flow. Different ion species are found to be dominant in the absence and presence of supersonic flow, highlighting the importance of including finite-rate chemistry effects in discharge models for understanding plasma actuator physical phenomena. Electrode polarity effects are investigated, and the cathode upstream actuation is found to be stronger than the actuation strength with the cathode downstream, which is consistent with experimental findings of several groups. © 2011 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

   abstract = {An important tool for improving the reliability of HV insulation systems are partial discharge (PD) measurements. The interpretation of such measurements aims at extracting from the measured data information about insulation defects which then are used for estimating the risk of insulation failure of the equipment. Because the physical understanding of PD has made substantial progress in the last decade, it can now be exploited to support interpretation. In this paper a concept is presented which merges the available physical knowledge about various PD types into a generalized model which can be applied to arbitrary insulation defects. This approach will be restricted to PD of the streamer type in gases and at gas-insulator interfaces which cover a large fraction of the cases encountered in technical insulation systems. The generalized model allows us to derive approximate relations between defect characteristics, insulation design parameters and test conditions on one side, and measurable PD characteristics on the other. The inversion of these relations yields rules for extracting defect information from the PD data. The application of the generalized model is illustrated by two simple examples, namely, spherical voids in an insulator and electrode protrusions in SF6. © 1995 IEEE},

The reported formulations represent extensions of ideas advanced recently by Ségur et al (2006) and Luque et al (2007), and allow fast and accurate solution of photoionization problems at different air pressures for the range , where is the partial pressure of molecular oxygen in air in units of Torr ( at atmospheric pressure) and R in cm is an effective geometrical size of the physical system of interest. The presented formulations can be extended to other gases and gas mixtures subject to availability of related emission, absorption and photoionization coefficients. The validity of the developed models is demonstrated by performing direct comparisons of the results from these models and results obtained from the classic integral model. Specific validation comparisons are presented for a set of artificial sources of photoionizing radiation with different Gaussian dimensions, and for a realistic problem involving development of a double-headed streamer at ground pressure. The reported results demonstrate the importance of accurate definition of the boundary conditions for the photoionization production rate for the solution of second order partial differential equations involved in the Eddington, SP3 and the Helmholtz formulations. The specific algorithms derived from the classic photoionization model of Zheleznyak et al (1982), allowing accurate calculations of boundary conditions for differential equations involved in all three new models described in this paper, are presented. It is noted that the accurate formulation of boundary conditions represents an important task needed for a successful extension of the proposed formulations to two- and three-dimensional physical systems with obstacles of complex geometry (i.e. electrodes, dust particles, aerosols, etc), which are opaque for the photoionizing UV photons. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {A computationally efficient model to evaluate stable glow corona discharges and their transition into streamers is proposed. The simplified physical model referred to as the SPM is based on the classic hydrodynamic model of charge particles and a quasi-steady state approximation for electrons. The solution follows a two-step segregated procedure, which solves sequentially the stationary continuity equation for electrons and then time-dependent continuity equations for ions. The validity of using the SPM to simulate glow corona discharges and their transition into streamers is demonstrated by performing comparisons with a fully coupled physical model (FPM) and with experimental data available in the literature for air under atmospheric conditions. It is shown that the SPM can obtain estimates similar to those calculated with the FPM and those measured in experiments but using significantly less computation time. Since the proposed model simulates efficiently the ionization layer without prior knowledge of the surface electric field or the discharge current, it is a computationally efficient alternative to calculations of glow corona discharges based on Kaptzov's approximation (KAM). The model can also be employed to efficiently calculate the conditions for the transition of glow corona into streamers, overcoming the limitations of KAM to provide such estimates.},

The critical rate of rise of voltage required for the transition from positive glow to streamer corona is evaluated with a voltage ramp. By introducing either physical or numerical instabilities into the model, streamers with filamentary structures are observed, which produce a sudden increase of the discharge current by more than two orders of magnitude.

The method is based on generating a coarser secondary grid and interpolating the photoionization values between the two meshes, in order to overcome the enormous effort required for calculation of photoionization in gas discharge problems. A comprehensive study of the effects of photoionization, photoemission and background ionization in a short point-plane gap in air at atmospheric pressure is then presented, by using the above approach for the secondary processes in two dimensions, in conjunction with the two-dimensional axisymmetric finite-element flux-corrected transport algorithm. The secondary processes are modelled individually within a wide range of parametric values to reflect the uncertainty in the experimental data, and their effect on streamer development and propagation is investigated. The significant reduction in time required for the calculations makes numerical modelling an essential tool for better understanding of the very important yet not well understood physical processes central to the propagation and development of streamers. Finally, numerical branching is observed under certain conditions in the absence of an adequate supply of electrons in high field regions.},

   abstract = {This paper presents the development of a direct accurate numerical method to solve the monochromatic radiative transfer equation (RTE) based on a finite volume method (FVM) and its application to the simulation of streamer propagation. The validity of the developed model is demonstrated by performing direct comparisons with results obtained using the classic integral model. Comparisons with approximate solutions of the RTE (Eddington and SP3 models) are also carried out. Specific validation comparisons are presented for an artificial source of radiation with a Gaussian shape. The reported results demonstrate that whatever the value of the absorption coefficient, the results obtained using the direct FVM are in excellent agreement with the reference integral model with a significantly reduced computation time. When the absorption coefficient is high enough, the Eddington and SP3 methods are as accurate and become faster than the FVM. However, when the absorption coefficient decreases, approximate methods become less accurate and more computationally expensive than the FVM. Then the direct finite volume and the SP3 models have been applied to the calculation of photoionization in a double-headed streamer at ground pressure. For high values of the absorption coefficient, positive and negative streamers calculated using the SP3 model and the FVM for the photoionization source term are in excellent agreement. As the value of the absorption coefficient decreases, discrepancies between the results obtained with the finite volume and the SP3 models increase, and these differences increase as the streamers advance. For low values of the absorption coefficient, the use of the SP3 model overestimates the electron density and underestimates the photoionization source term in both streamers in comparison with the FVM. As a consequence, for low values of the absorption coefficient, positive and negative streamers calculated using the SP3 model for the photoionization source term propagate more slowly than those calculated using the FVM. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

It is shown, that fundamental space scale of streamer - the width of space charge layer lρ (ionization domain) around its head is defined by the length of absorption of photoionizing radiation la. This length defines all other parameters: electron density, radius of streamer channel etc, so one may speak about standard streamer in air, whose properties depend only on pressure. Based on simulation results one may assume that streamer branching occurs in high field, when lρ exceeds la. The process of branching may be interpreted as an instability which transforms the non-standard streamer into a number of standard ones.},

   abstract = {Streamers are the first stage of sparks and lightning; they grow due to a strongly enhanced electric field at their tips; this field is created by a thin curved space charge layer. These multiple scales are already challenging when the electrons are approximated by densities. However, electron density fluctuations in the leading edge of the front and non-thermal stretched tails of the electron energy distribution (as a cause of X-ray emissions) require a particle model to follow the electron motion. But present computers cannot deal with all electrons in a fully developed streamer. Therefore, super-particle have to be introduced, which leads to wrong statistics and numerical artifacts. The method of choice is a hybrid computation in space where individual electrons are followed in the region of high electric field and low density while the bulk of the electrons is approximated by densities (or fluids). We here develop the hybrid coupling for planar fronts. First, to obtain a consistent flux at the interface between particle and fluid model in the hybrid computation, the widely used classical fluid model is replaced by an extended fluid model. Then the coupling algorithm and the numerical implementation of the spatially hybrid model are presented in detail, in particular, the position of the model interface and the construction of the buffer region. The method carries generic features of pulled fronts that can be applied to similar problems like large deviations in the leading edge of population fronts, etc. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore the model is computationally efficient, while it also follows the dynamics of single electrons including their possible run-away. Here we describe the technical details of our computations, and present the next step in a systematic development of the simulation code. First, new sets of transport coefficients and reaction rates are obtained from particle swarm simulations in air, nitrogen, oxygen and argon. These coefficients are implemented in an extended fluid model to make the fluid approximation as consistent as possible with the particle model, and to avoid discontinuities at the interface between fluid and particle regions. Then two splitting methods are introduced and compared for the location and motion of the fluid-particle-interface in three spatial dimensions. Finally, we present first results of the 3D spatially hybrid model for a negative streamer in air. Future applications of the hybrid model lie in effects of electron density fluctuations on inception, propagation and branching of streamers, and in accurate calculations of electron energies at and of electron run-away from the streamer head.

   abstract = {Streamer branching in liquid dielectrics is driven by stochastic and deterministic factors. The presence of stochastic causes of streamer branching such as inhomogeneities inherited from noisy initial states, impurities, or charge carrier density fluctuations is inevitable in any dielectric. A fully three-dimensional streamer model presented in this paper indicates that deterministic origins of branching are intrinsic attributes of streamers, which in some cases make the branching inevitable depending on shape and velocity of the volume charge at the streamer frontier. Specifically, any given inhomogeneous perturbation can result in streamer branching if the volume charge layer at the original streamer head is relatively thin and slow enough. Furthermore, discrete nature of electrons at the leading edge of an ionization front always guarantees the existence of a non-zero inhomogeneous perturbation ahead of the streamer head propagating even in perfectly homogeneous dielectric. Based on the modeling results for streamers propagating in a liquid dielectric, a gauge on the streamer head geometry is introduced that determines whether the branching occurs under particular inhomogeneous circumstances. Estimated number, diameter, and velocity of the born branches agree qualitatively with experimental images of the streamer branching. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

   abstract = {We present an adaptive, finite volume algorithm to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in complex geometries. The algorithm is based on the embedded boundary method, in which finite volume approximations are used to discretize the solution in cut cells that result from intersecting the irregular boundary with a structured Cartesian grid. This approach is conservative and reduces to a standard finite difference method in grid cells away from the boundary. We solve the incompressible flow equations using a predictor-corrector formulation. Hyperbolic advection terms are obtained by higher-order upwinding without the use of extrapolated data in covered cells. The small-cell stability problem associated with explicit embedded boundary methods for hyperbolic systems is avoided by the use of a volume-weighted scheme in the advection step and is consistent with construction of the right-hand side of the elliptic solvers. The Helmholtz equations resulting from viscous source terms are advanced in time by the Crank-Nicolson method, which reduces solver runtime compared to other second-order time integrators by a half. Incompressibility is enforced by a secondorder approximate projection method that makes use of a new conservative cellcentered gradient in cut cells that is consistent with the volume-weighted scheme. The algorithm is also capable of block structured adaptive mesh refinement to increase spatial resolution dynamically in regions of interest. The resulting overall method is second-order accurate for sufficiently smooth problems. In addition, the algorithm is implemented in a high-performance computing framework and can perform structured-grid fluid dynamics calculations at unprecedented scale and resolution, up to 262,144 processor cores. We demonstrate robustness and performance of the algorithm by simulating incompressible flow for a wide range of Reynolds numbers in two and three dimensions: Stokes and low Reynolds number flows in both constructed and image data geometries (Re«1 to Re D 1), flow past a cylinder (Re = 300), flow past a sphere (Re = 600) and turbulent flow in a contraction (Re = 6300).},

We used MUSCL-type flux limiters where an artificial amount of numerical diffusion can be introduced through the choice of the value of a characteristic slope parameter. It was shown that a small amount of numerical diffusion can inhibit the spontaneous streamer branching. This means that the use of a high-order numerical scheme preventing the numerical diffusion and dispersion is a major parameter that must be taken into account in the interpretation of the simulated streamer development and splitting. This paper also clearly shows that the consideration of the anisotropy of electron diffusion affects the streamer head structure in comparison with the isotropic diffusion case.

   abstract = {The discrete ordinates method (DOM) and finite-volume method (FVM) are used extensively to solve the radiative transfer equation (RTE) in furnaces and combusting mixtures due to their balance between numerical efficiency and accuracy. These methods produce a system of coupled partial differential equations which are typically solved using space-marching techniques since they converge rapidly for constant coefficient spatial discretization schemes and non-scattering media. However, space-marching methods lose their effectiveness when applied to scattering media because the intensities in different directions become tightly coupled. When these methods are used in combination with high-resolution limited total-variation-diminishing (TVD) schemes, the additional non-linearities introduced by the flux limiting process can result in excessive iterations for most cases or even convergence failure for scattering media. Space-marching techniques may also not be quite as well-suited for the solution of problems involving complex three-dimensional geometries and/or for use in highly-scalable parallel algorithms. A novel pseudo-time marching algorithm is therefore proposed herein to solve the DOM or FVM equations on multi-block body-fitted meshes using a highly scalable parallel-implicit solution approach in conjunction with high-resolution TVD spatial discretization. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is also employed to properly capture disparate solution scales with a reduced number of grid points. The scheme is assessed in terms of discontinuity-capturing capabilities, spatial and angular solution accuracy, scalability, and serial performance through comparisons to other commonly employed solution techniques. The proposed algorithm is shown to possess excellent parallel scaling characteristics and can be readily applied to problems involving complex geometries. In particular, greater than 85% parallel efficiency is demonstrated for a strong scaling problem on up to 256 processors. Furthermore, a speedup of a factor of at least two was observed over a standard space-marching algorithm using a limited scheme for optically thick scattering media. Although the time-marching approach is approximately four times slower for absorbing media, it vastly outperforms standard solvers when parallel speedup is taken into account. The latter is particularly true for geometrically complex computational domains. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {The results of a two-dimensional simulation of a cylindrically symmetric positive streamer in atmospheric pressure air between parallel plate electrodes are reported. A hydrodynamic diffusion - drift model was used. The results show that the streamer radius and velocity grow exponentially in time. We have found that the main parameter which governs streamer propagation is the width of the space charge front Rρ. It is shown that: (i) the field at the tip of the streamer is equivalent to the field of a charged ball of radius Rρ; and (ii) the streamer velocity is proportional to Rρ, as previously predicted by Loeb [1]. The mechanism of streamer propagation is discussed. It is shown that positive streamer advancement occurs due to avalanche multiplication of primary photoelectrons in the narrow layer of the width Rρ ahead of the streamer. The energy delivered by the power supply is calculated. This energy accumulates as electrostatic energy of the space charge envelope around streamer channel. The energy increases exponentially in time and reaches ≃ 102 J when the streamer radius is about 20 cm.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a new resolution strategy for multi-scale streamer discharge simulations based on a second order time adaptive integration and space adaptive multiresolution. A classical fluid model is used to describe plasma discharges, considering drift-diffusion equations and the computation of electric field. The proposed numerical method provides a time-space accuracy control of the solution, and thus, an effective accurate resolution independent of the fastest physical time scale. An important improvement of the computational efficiency is achieved whenever the required time steps go beyond standard stability constraints associated with mesh size or source time scales for the resolution of the drift-diffusion equations, whereas the stability constraint related to the dielectric relaxation time scale is respected but with a second order precision. Numerical illustrations show that the strategy can be efficiently applied to simulate the propagation of highly nonlinear ionizing waves as streamer discharges, as well as highly multi-scale nanosecond repetitively pulsed discharges, describing consistently a broad spectrum of space and time scales as well as different physical scenarios for consecutive discharge/post-discharge phases, out of reach of standard non-adaptive methods. © 2011 Elsevier Inc..},

We use the enthalpy density, i.e. the sum of the energy density and the isotropic component of the pressure, instead of the energy density in both forms. The former serves to show us that the ratio of the flux to the enthalpy density denotes the bulk velocity of the radiation in the M1 model.

The approach uses a finite-volume discretization, which embeds the domain in a regular Cartesian grid. We treat the solution as a cell-centered quantity, even when those centers are outside the domain. Cells that contain a portion of the domain boundary use conservative differencing of second-order accurate fluxes on each cell volume. The calculation of the boundary flux ensures that the conditioning of the matrix is relatively unaffected by small cell volumes. This allows us to use multigrid iterations with a simple point relaxation strategy. We have combined this with an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) procedure. We provide evidence that the algorithm is second-order accurate on various exact solutions and compare the adaptive and nonadaptive calculations. © 1998 Academic Press.},

The yields of electrons per ion, fast atom and photon vary greatly with particle energy and surface condition. Then models of electron, ion, fast atom, excited atom and photon transport and kinetics are fitted to electrical-breakdown and low-current, discharge-maintenance data to determine the contributions of various cathode-directed species to the secondary electron production. Our model explains measured breakdown and low-current discharge voltages for Ar over a very wide range of electric field to gas density ratios E/n, e.i. 15 Td to 100 kTd.

   abstract = {This paper presents simulations of an air plasma discharge at atmospheric pressure initiated by a needle anode set inside a dielectric capillary tube. We have studied the influence of the tube inner radius and its relative permittivity εr on the discharge structure and dynamics. As a reference, we have used a relative permittivity εr = 1 to study only the influence of the cylindrical constraint of the tube on the discharge. For a tube radius of 100 μm and εr = 1, we have shown that the discharge fills the tube during its propagation and is rather homogeneous behind the discharge front. When the radius of the tube is in the range 300-600 μm, the discharge structure is tubular with peak values of electric field and electron density close to the dielectric surface. When the radius of the tube is larger than 700 μm, the tube has no influence on the discharge which propagates axially. For a tube radius of 100 μm, when εr increases from 1 to 10, the discharge structure becomes tubular. We have noted that the velocity of propagation of the discharge in the tube increases when the front is more homogeneous and then, the discharge velocity increases with the decrease in the tube radius and εr. Then, we have compared the relative influence of the value of the tube radius and εr on the discharge characteristics. Our simulations indicate that the geometrical constraint of the cylindrical tube has more influence than the value of εr on the discharge structure and dynamics. Finally, we have studied the influence of photoemission processes on the discharge structure by varying the photoemission coefficient. As expected, we have shown that photoemission, as it increases the number of secondary electrons close to the dielectric surface, promotes the tubular structure of the discharge. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Geometrical effects of electrodes and solid barriers immersed in transformer oil are investigated on positive streamer initiation, propagation, and transformation to surface flashover using a 2-D axisymmetric model. Electrode radii of curvature in the range of 20 μm to 6.35 mm are selected such that only positive streamers form. Modeling results indicate that the positive electrode size directly determines the streamer initiation voltage, while breakdown voltage and delay are mainly determined by the grounded electrode size. Specifically, sharper positive electrodes require lower voltages to initiate positive streamers and sharper grounded electrodes result in lower delays and higher breakdown voltages. Incorporating perpendicular and parallel orientations of solid barrier interfaces in the electrohydrodynamic model shows that polarization forces from the barrier dielectrics on charge carrying streamers are proportional to the permittivity difference between transformer oil and the solid dielectric. If the barrier permittivity is greater than the oil permittivity, the solid dielectric applies an attractive force on the volume charge that turns the streamer into a surface flashover expanding on the barrier surface. On the other hand, a low permittivity pressboard interface repels the approaching streamer. Theoretical analysis of electric field propagation and charge distribution along the streamers, surface flashovers, and through the interfacial surfaces is presented. Barrier dielectric relative permittivities of 1.1 and 4.4 have been studied while the oil relative permittivity is assumed 2.2. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

The flow solver is responsible for determining the bulk flow kinetics of dominant neutral background species including mole fractions, gas temperature, pressure and velocity. The plasma solver determines the kinetics and energetics of the plasma species and accounts for finite rate chemistry. In order to achieve maximum reliability and best performance, we have utilized state-of-the-art numerical and theoretical approaches for the simulation of DBD plasma actuators. In this respect, to obtain a stable and accurate solution method, we tested and compared different existing numerical procedures, including operator-splitting algorithm, super-time-stepping, and solution of the Poisson and transport equations in a semi-implicit manner. The implementation of the model is conducted in OpenFOAM. Four numerical test cases are considered in order to validate the solvers and to investigate the drawbacks/benefits of the solution approaches. The test problems include single DBD actuator driven by positive, negative and sinusoidal voltage waveforms, similar to the ones that could be found in literature. The accuracy of the results strongly depends to the choice of time step, grid size and discretization scheme. The results indicate that the super-time-stepping treatment improves the computational efficiency in comparison to explicit schemes. However, the semi-implicit treatment of the Poisson and transport equations showed better performance compared to the other tested approaches.},

   abstract = {This paper presents simulations of an atmospheric pressure air discharge in a point-to-plane geometry with a dielectric layer parallel to the cathode plane. Experimentally, a discharge reignition in the air gap below the dielectrics has been observed. With a 2D fluid model, it is shown that due to the fast rise of the high voltage applied and the sharp point used, a first positive spherical discharge forms around the point. Then this discharge propagates axially and impacts the dielectrics. As the first discharge starts spreading on the upper dielectric surface, in the second air gap with a low preionization density of 104cm-3, the 2D fluid model predicts a rapid reignition of a positive discharge. As in experiments, the discharge reignition is much slower, a discussion on physical processes to be considered in the model to increase the reignition delay is presented. The limit case with no initial seed charges in the second air gap has been studied. First, we have calculated the time to release an electron from the cathode surface by thermionic and field emission processes for a work function φ∈ [3, 4] eV and an amplification factor β∈ [100, 220]. Then a 3D Monte Carlo model has been used to follow the dynamics of formation of an avalanche starting from a single electron emitted at the cathode. Due to the high electric field in the second air gap, we have shown that in a few nanoseconds, a Gaussian cloud of seed charges is formed at a small distance from the cathode plane. This Gaussian cloud has been used as the initial condition of the 2D fluid model in the second air gap. In this case, the propagation of a double headed discharge in the second air gap has been observed and the reignition delay is in rather good agreement with experiments.},

We incorporate these electron-density fluctuations into fully three-dimensional simulations of a positive streamer in air at standard temperature and pressure. We derive a quantitative estimate for the ratio of branching length to streamer diameter that agrees within a factor of 2 with experimental measurements.

Therefore we study streamers in nitrogen with 20%, 0.2% and 0.01% oxygen and in pure nitrogen as well as in pure oxygen and argon. Our new experimental set-up guarantees contamination of the pure gases to be well below 1 ppm. Streamers in oxygen are difficult to measure as they emit considerably less light in the sensitivity range of our fast ICCD camera than the other gases. Streamers in pure nitrogen and in all nitrogen-oxygen mixtures look generally similar, but become somewhat thinner and branch more with decreasing oxygen content. In pure nitrogen the streamers can branch so much that they resemble feathers. This feature is even more pronounced in pure argon, with approximately 102 hair tips cm-3 in the feathers at 200 mbar; this density can be interpreted as the free electron density creating avalanches towards the streamer stem. It is remarkable that the streamer velocity is essentially the same for similar voltage and pressure in all nitrogen-oxygen mixtures as well as in pure nitrogen, while the oxygen concentration and therefore the photo-ionization lengths vary by more than five orders of magnitude. Streamers in argon have essentially the same velocity as well. The physical similarity of streamers at different pressures is confirmed in all gases; the minimal diameters are smaller than in earlier measurements. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

For positive polarity the intense sheath region is formed near the surface having high values of the electric field. The negative streamer has a lower field at the streamer front and in the sheath region. The disparity between the positive and negative surface streamers increases when electron Monte Carlo simulation is used that treats the energetic secondary electrons in a fully kinetic way. We also found that for a negative polarity applied to the exposed electrode, a thin layer of precursor electrons ahead of a streamer is formed having a shape of a narrow protruding needle.

We have validated that for electropositive gases Ar an N2 the generally assumed value of K = 10 is in good agreement with our measurements. For electronegative gases, however, the experimentally obtained values turned out to be considerably higher. We attribute this discrepancy mainly to the statistical time delay of the first electron; to increase the probability of discharge inception in a critical region, it was necessary to extend the critical area by means of applying an overvoltage to the system.},

   abstract = {Numerical fluid models are widely used in gas discharge physics. A typical discharge model comprises continuity equations and drift-diffusion equations for reactive particle species, a balance equation for the electron energy, and Poisson's equation for the electric field. When this system of equations is integrated numerically with respect to time, the explicit evaluation of coupled quantities necessitates strong time step restrictions, resulting in an enormous slowdown of the calculation. The strongest time step restriction arises from an explicit treatment of the coupling between the charged particle transport and the space charge field. In order to circumvent this constraint several implicit and semi-implicit techniques have been developed. When one uses these techniques, however, the explicit handling of the dependence of electron energy source term on the electron mean energy becomes limiting for the time step. In this work we present a technique for the implicit treatment of the electron energy source term, based on linearization with respect to the electron mean energy. This approach makes it possible to increase the time step by several orders of magnitude, thus giving a tremendous speedup of the calculation. Test results are provided for some typical cases, covering a wide range of numerical conditions. © 2000 Academic Press.},

In this work, a new approach based on the direct solution of an approximate radiative transfer equation is developed. Different approximations of the radiative transfer equation are discussed and tested for typical conditions encountered in streamer discharges. An improved Eddington approximation is shown to be very accurate to calculate the photoionization term for a Gaussian emission source term with a half-width length of the order of 0.02 cm when the absorption coefficient of the gas is higher than or equal to 50 cm-1. For steeper gradients of the source term, good agreement is obtained for higher values of the absorption coefficient. Furthermore, the computation time of the improved Eddington method is four orders of magnitude less than with the usual integral method. For streamer propagation in air at atmospheric pressure, the absorption coefficient is shown to be of the order of 130 cm-1 which validates the use of the improved Eddington approximation to calculate the photoionization term. Finally, two-dimensional calculations of a positive streamer discharge in air at atmospheric pressure in plane-plane geometry with the improved Eddington approximation are presented. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

First, the dielectric layer is placed on the cathode plane and we study the influence of the permittivity and thickness of the dielectric on the positive streamer discharge dynamics and the dielectric surface charging. We show that the velocity of the surface discharge on the dielectric surface depends on the capacitance of the dielectric layer and decreases as this capacitance increases. Conversely, the amount of positive surface charge deposited by the positive surface discharge on the dielectric surface is not directly related to the value of the capacitance of the dielectric layer. However, the amount of surface charge deposited increases as the capacitance of the dielectric layer increases. Second, the dielectric layer is placed in the air gap as an obstacle for the propagation of the first streamer discharge ignited at the point electrode. In this case, after the impact on the dielectric, the first discharge spreads along the upper dielectric surface and we show that, depending on the location of the dielectric layer, its permittivity, its thickness and its opacity to radiation, a second discharge may reignite or not below the dielectric layer. During the discharge dynamics, positive charges are deposited on the upper surface of the dielectric and negative charges are deposited on its bottom surface. For all conditions studied in this work, we show that surface charge deposition on both faces of the dielectric layer has a small influence on the discharge reignition below the dielectric layer. Finally, with two closely spaced dielectric layers in the path of the discharge, a series of spreading/reignition for each dielectric layer is observed. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The focus is on the difference between the slow 2nd and fast 3rd mode streamers discussed in the literature. Through the use of numerical methods the model demonstrates that streamer modes arise in transformer oil due to the electric field dependent molecular ionization of different families of hydrocarbon molecules (i.e., aromatic, naphthenic, and paraffinic) at increasing electric field levels (or applied voltages). Ionization of the low number density aromatic molecules, that generally have lower ionization energies than naphthenic/paraffinic molecules, leads to the propagation of 2nd mode streamers with velocities on the order of 1 km/s. As the applied voltage is increased, the ionization of the main hydrocarbon molecules in transformer oil, high number density naphthenic/paraffinic molecules, dominates producing high electric field levels and space charge at the streamer tip. This ultimately leads to the propagation of the 3rd mode streamer with velocities on the order of 10 km/s. ©2009 IEEE.},

The bubbles can originate by enthalpy changes produced by the discharge or can be artificially injected into the liquid. Experiments on streamers in bubbles immersed in liquids have shown that the discharge propagates either along the surface of the bubble or through the volume of the bubble as in conventional streamer propagation in air. In this paper we report on results of a computational investigation of streamer propagation through bubbles immersed in liquids. We found that the dielectric constant of the liquid in large part determines the path the streamer takes. Streamers in bubbles immersed in a liquid with a high permittivity preferentially propagate along the surface of the bubble. Liquids with low permittivity can result in the streamer propagating along the axis of the bubble. The permittivity at which this transition occurs is a function of the applied voltage, size of the bubble and the conductivity of the liquid. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {A kinetic scheme for non-equilibrium discharge in nitrogen-oxygen mixtures is developed, which almost wholly describes chemical transformations of particles in the cold (200 K<or=T<or=500 K) vibrationally unexcited gas. The kinetic scheme includes processes of excitation of electronic states, destruction and ionization of heavy particles by electron impact, associative ionization, electron attachment and detachment, electron-ion and ion-ion recombination, chemical transformations of neutral particles (in ground and excited electronic states) and ion conversion. On the basis of kinetic modelling in the framework of the kinetic scheme proposed, the influence of the electronic excitations of nitrogen molecules and atoms on air composition dynamics is analysed.},

   abstract = {This paper concerns the 3D simulation of corona discharge using high performance computing (HPC) managed with the message passing interface (MPI) library. In the field of finite volume methods applied on non-adaptive mesh grids and in the case of a specific 3D dynamic benchmark test devoted to streamer studies, the great efficiency of the iterative R&B SOR and BiCGSTAB methods versus the direct MUMPS method was clearly demonstrated in solving the Poisson equation using HPC resources. The optimization of the parallelization and the resulting scalability was undertaken as a function of the HPC architecture for a number of mesh cells ranging from 8 to 512 million and a number of cores ranging from 20 to 1600. The R&B SOR method remains at least about four times faster than the BiCGSTAB method and requires significantly less memory for all tested situations. The R&B SOR method was then implemented in a 3D MPI parallelized code that solves the classical first order model of an atmospheric pressure corona discharge in air. The 3D code capabilities were tested by following the development of one, two and four coplanar streamers generated by initial plasma spots for 6 ns. The preliminary results obtained allowed us to follow in detail the formation of the tree structure of a corona discharge and the effects of the mutual interactions between the streamers in terms of streamer velocity, trajectory and diameter. The computing time for 64 million of mesh cells distributed over 1000 cores using the MPI procedures is about 30 min ns-1, regardless of the number of streamers.},

@article{Kolobov2012,
   abstract = {This paper describes an Adaptive Mesh and Algorithm Refinement (AMAR) methodology for multi-scale simulations of gas flows and the challenges associated with extending this methodology for simulations of weakly ionized plasmas. The AMAR method combines Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) with automatic selection of kinetic or continuum solvers in different parts of computational domains. We first review the discrete velocity method for solving Boltzmann and Wang Chang-Uhlenbeck kinetic equations for rarefied gases. Then, peculiarities of AMR implementation with octree Cartesian mesh are discussed. A Unified Flow Solver (UFS) uses AMAR method with adaptive Cartesian mesh to dynamically introduce kinetic patches for multi-scale simulations of gas flows. We describe fluid plasma models with AMR capabilities and illustrate how physical models affect simulation results for gas discharges, especially in the areas where electron kinetics plays an important role. We introduce Eulerian solvers for plasma kinetic equations and illustrate the concept of adaptive mesh in velocity space. Specifics of electron kinetics in collisional plasmas are described focusing on deterministic methods of solving kinetic equations for electrons under different conditions. We illustrate the appearance of distinct groups of electrons in the cathode region of DC discharges and discuss the physical models appropriate for each group. These kinetic models are currently being incorporated into AMAR methodology for multi-scale plasma simulations. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {We present an open-source plasma fluid code for 2D, cylindrical and 3D simulations of streamer discharges. The code is based on the Afivo framework, which features adaptive mesh refinement on quadtree/octree grids, geometric multigrid methods for Poisson's equation, and OpenMP parallelism. We describe the numerical implementation of a fluid model of the drift-diffusion-reaction type, combined with the local field approximation. Then we demonstrate its functionality with 3D simulations of long positive streamers in nitrogen in undervolted gaps. Three examples are presented. The first one shows how a stochastic background density affects streamer propagation and branching. The second one focuses on the interaction of a streamer with preionized regions, and the third one investigates the interaction between two streamers. The simulations use up to 108 grid cells and run in less than a day; without mesh refinement they would require more than grid cells.},

@article{Hagelaar2005,
   abstract = {Fluid models of gas discharges require the input of transport coefficients and rate coefficients that depend on the electron energy distribution function. Such coefficients are usually calculated from collision cross-section data by solving the electron Boltzmann equation (BE). In this paper we present a new user-friendly BE solver developed especially for this purpose, freely available under the name BOLSIG+, which is more general and easier to use than most other BE solvers available. The solver provides steady-state solutions of the BE for electrons in a uniform electric field, using the classical two-term expansion, and is able to account for different growth models, quasi-stationary and oscillating fields, electron-neutral collisions and electron-electron collisions. We show that for the approximations we use, the BE takes the form of a convection-diffusion continuity-equation with a non-local source term in energy space. To solve this equation we use an exponential scheme commonly used for convection-diffusion problems. The calculated electron transport coefficients and rate coefficients are defined so as to ensure maximum consistency with the fluid equations. We discuss how these coefficients are best used in fluid models and illustrate the influence of some essential parameters and approximations. © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The pattern of discharge branching upon variation of pressure is investigated experimentally. The results are given of comparison of the predicted and measured values of anode current, streamer propagation velocity, and channel diameter. It has been demonstrated that the electric field in the streamer head is hardly affected by the pressure decrease, while the electron concentration decreases with pressure by an order of magnitude. At the same time, production of chemical species in a cathode-directed streamer discharge varies at a rate of at least the second power of inverse pressure. © 2005 The American Physical Society.},

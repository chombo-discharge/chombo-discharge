Visualization
=============

``chombo-discharge`` output files are always written to HDF5.
The plot files will reside in the ``plt`` subfolder where the application was run.

Currently, we have only used `VisIt <https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/>`_ for visualizing the plot files.
Learning how to use VisIt is not a part of this documentation; there are great tutorials on the `VisIt website <https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/>`_.

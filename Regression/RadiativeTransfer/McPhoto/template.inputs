# MC_PHOTO CLASS OPTIONS
#
# The McPhoto class is intended as a flexible RTE solver that may interface into several descriptions.
# Because of that we allow several deposition types, e.g. cloud-in-cell if one wants to compute photoionization
# profiles with less noise. If one wants the photoionization profile (which is what gets passed around
# in the TimeStepper framework) to contain just the number of Photons in a cell, one would use
# deposition_type = num. This is useful for SSA type algorithms. 
#
# Since the photoproduction source term is filled externally, and the filling of this depends on the
# CFD/FHD description, McPhoto.source_type species what the solver will expect when drawing Photons.
# For example, if one species 'volume_rate', McPhoto will interpret the internal data so as to contain
# a rate per unit volume. The number of Photons produced in a volume will then be S*dx^3*dt. If you
# filled the source term with just the number of Photons that will be produced in a cell, you should
# use source_type = number.
#
# The photogeneration mechanism can be done stochastically or determinsitically. How this is interpreted
# depends on how you implemented your source terms through the plasma_kinetics interface (or equivalent).
# This design makes sense for FHD models because the number of Photons produced in a cell can be
# computed directly, e.g. with SSA algorithms. In this way the stochasticity is provided by the SSA
# algorithm and one would use McPhoto.source_type = deterministic. For CFD models one would probably
# work with a volumetric rate, in which one could draw the number of Photons from a Poisson distribution.

This file contains descriptions of the main high level startup and
window creation functions.

-----------------------------------------------------------

int    OpenDisplay(int argc, char **argv);

This function initiates everything with libsx.  You should call this 
function before you call any of the other functions.  A correctly
written application will call OpenDisplay(), passing its command line
arguments and count.  The return value from this function is the new
number of arguments (or zero if an error occurred).  The X libraries
accept various standard command line options such as -display or
-font, and if your application passes the command line arguments to
OpenDisplay(), these will be handled properly.  Any X options are
removed from the argv array, therefore it is best if you do your
command line processing _after_ calling OpenDisplay().

You only need to call this function once to initialize the first
window your program uses.  Any other windows you need should be
created with MakeWindow().

Technically, calling OpenDisplay() is optional (the MakeXXX() routines
will call it for you if you didn't), but it's usually a good idea to
call it (since it is only one line of code and it's pretty
straightforward. 

This function returns FALSE (0) if something went wrong (like being
unable to open the display, etc). If everything went ok, it returns
the new number of arguments in argv.

-----------------------------------------------------------

void   ShowDisplay(void);

This function displays the currently active window (user interface)
you've created with the MakeXXX() calls.  After this call completes,
the interface will be visible on the display.

Until you call this function, your interface will not be visible and
drawing into a draw area will have no effect.

Usually one calls ShowDisplay(), allocates some colors and then
immediately calls MainLoop().  If you do not call ShowDisplay(), but
just directly call MainLoop(), then MainLoop() implicitly calls
ShowDisplay().  

SEE ALSO: MainLoop(), MakeWindow() 
-----------------------------------------------------------

void   MainLoop(void);

After calling this function, your program yields control to the user
interface, and it is entirely driven by what the user does and the
callbacks associated with the various widgets.  For a single window
application, the general flow of events is:

    OpenDisplay(argc, argv);   /* initialize the first window */

    MakeButton(....);          /* create widgets */

    ShowDisplay();             /* put the window on the screen */
                               /* optionally allocate colors */
    MainLoop();                /* start the main loop going */


When you call this after calling ShowDisplay() for your first window
(created by OpenDisplay()), the MainLoop() function never returns and
your application should have some callback function that will exit()
the program (such as a quit button or menu option).

If you did not call ShowDisplay(), MainLoop() will call it for you and
then launch into the main loop.

You should not call MainLoop() for NONEXCLUSIVE mode windows created
with MakeWindow().  Those type of windows have their callbacks handled
by the MainLoop() function that is already executing (i.e. the one you
called for your original window).

If the window is an EXCLUSIVE mode window, then MainLoop() keeps
executing until CloseWindow() is called on the EXCLUSIVE mode window.
That is, MainLoop() blocks until the EXCLUSIVE mode window is closed,
and then it returns.

If you create a non-exclusive mode window, the general order of events
is:

      MakeWindow(NONEXCLUSIVE_WINDOW, ....);
      MakeButton(...);
      ShowDisplay();

This creates a window, puts interface objects into it, and then puts
that window on the screen.  No other actions need to be taken, and
when the callback that created this new window returns, all processing
takes place normally, including the processing of the new window and
its callbacks.


For a window of EXCLUSIVE_WINDOW mode (like a popup), the general
order execution is:

      MakeWindow(EXCLUSIVE_WINDOW, ....);
      MakeButton(...);
      ShowDisplay();

      MainLoop();     /* blocks until CloseWindow() is called */

      /* do something with whatever values the popup got for us */

When MainLoop() returns for an EXCLUSIVE_WINDOW, the window has been
closed.

-----------------------------------------------------------

void   SyncDisplay(void);

This function synchronizes the display with all drawing requests you
have made.  Normally it is not necessary to call this function, but if
you make many repeated function calls to draw graphics, they will be
updated in a chunky fashion because X buffers drawing requests and
sends a bunch of them at once.

After this function completes, all drawing requests you have made are
visible on the screen.

NOTE: Normally you do not need to call this function because X ensures
      that everything you request gets drawn, but sometimes it is
      necessary to insure the synchronization of the display.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Widget MakeWindow(char *window_name, char *display_name, int exclusive);

NOTE: Do not call this function to open your first window. Your
      application's first window is opened for you by OpenDisplay().
      If your application only needs one window, do NOT call this
      function. 

This function opens a new window, possibly on a different display
(workstation).  The new window has the name specified by the argument
window_name and is opened on the display named by display_name (a
string usually in the form of, "machine_name:0.0").  The final
argument indicates whether the window should be an exclusive window or
not (described below).

After this functions returns, the current window is the one you just
created and you can begin adding widgets to it with the MakeXXX()
calls.  After have created and added any widgets you want, you should
call ShowDisplay(), and if the window is an EXCLUSIVE_MODE window,
then you should call MainLoop() (which blocks until the window is
closed).  If you opened the window with the NONEXCLUSIVE_WINDOW
option, you should NOT call MainLoop().

If you pass a NULL for the window_name, it receives a default title of
"Untitled".

If you pass the #define, SAME_DISPLAY, for the display name, the
window opens on the same display as the original window opened by
OpenDisplay(). 

The argument, exclusive, indicates what type of window to open.  A
normal window is a NONEXCLUSIVE_WINDOW.  That is, it will not block
the user from interacting with your existing window.  An
EXCLUSIVE_WINDOW is a popup window that blocks input to your main
window until the popup is closed with CloseWindow().

The EXCLUSIVE_WINDOW mode is useful for requestors that need an answer
and the user should not be able to do other things in the application.
Of course some user-interface folks don't think modal windows like
this are good, but tough cookies for them because some times it's
necessary. 


SEE ALSO: SetCurrentWindow()
-----------------------------------------------------------
void   SetCurrentWindow(Widget w);
  
This function sets the currently active window for other function
calls such as CloseWindow().  If you have multiple windows open on
several displays, you must call this function switch the currently
active one when you wish to manipulate the various windows. 

The argument, w, must be a valid value returned by MakeWindow().  If
you would like to set the current window to be the original window
opened by OpenDisplay(), you can pass the #define, ORIGINAL_WINDOW.

When you change windows, the current drawing area is also changed to
be the last current drawing area in the new window (if there is a
drawing area in the new window).


SEE ALSO: MakeWindow(), CloseWindow()
-----------------------------------------------------------
void   CloseWindow(void);

This function closes and removes from the display, the currently
active window.

After calling this function, you should not refer to any of the
widgets contained in the window as they are invalid (as is the window
handle).

			-- How to Use libsx --

Using libsx is pretty simple.  At the minimum, you #include "libsx.h"
and link with libsx.a.  To actually have X windows pop open and such,
you need to do the following:

   1) To get everything started, you should call OpenDisplay().
      If OpenDisplay() returns a non-zero value, it's ok to go on.
      OpenDisplay() creates what will eventually be your first 
      window. 
     
   2) After calling OpenDisplay(), you can go on to create all sorts
      of widgets with the MakeXXX() calls.  You can lay them out with
      calls to SetWidgetPos().

   3) When you are done creating the user interface, call
      ShowDisplay().  This causes the window and components you've
      created to be displayed on the workstation screen.

      Until you call ShowDisplay(), the user can _NOT_ see your
      window, and drawing into drawing areas has _NO_ effect.

   3.5) If you need to, you can call any of the color allocation
        functions such as GetStandardColors(), etc.

   4) Finally, once the window is displayed and you've done all the
      initializations you wish, you must then call MainLoop(). After
      you call MainLoop(), events get processed as they come in and
      your callback functions are called as necessary.

      After calling MainLoop(), the correct way for your program to
      exit is to have one of your callback routines call exit() when
      appropriate (like after the user clicks on a "Quit" button).


That's all you need to do.  Even though that may look like a lot to
do, it's really pretty simple in practice.  For example, here is a
hello world program with libsx:

------------------------------------------------------------------
#include "libsx.h"

main()
{
  MakeLabel("Hello World!");
  MainLoop();
}

------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Granted it's one more line than a standard printf() type of hello
world program, but it's not all that bad. 


Hello world programs are nice, but you don't tend to write very many
of them.  Real applications need to be able to do much more.  Even
these "real" programs aren't all that bad in libsx. 

Here is a simple program that opens a window with a quit button and a
drawing area that you could use to draw whatever graphics you wanted: 


------------------------------------------------------------------

#include <stdio.h>
#include "libsx.h"


void quit(Widget w, void *data)
{
  exit(0);
}


void draw_stuff(Widget w, int width, int height, void *data)
{
  ClearDrawArea();
  DrawLine(0,0, width, height);   /* just draw a diagonal line */
}
  


int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  Widget w[2];


  argc = OpenDisplay(argc, argv);
  if (argc == 0)                   /* woops, couldn't get started */
    exit(5);
  
  
  w[0] = MakeButton("Quit", quit, NULL);
  w[1] = MakeDrawArea(300,300, draw_stuff, NULL);

  SetWidgetPos(w[1], PLACE_UNDER, w[0], NO_CARE, NULL);

  ShowDisplay();
  GetStandardColors();

  MainLoop();   /* off we go! */
}

------------------------------------------------------------------

The code above is the basic skeleton for a libsx program, even
complicated ones.  First you open the display with OpenDisplay().
Then you build your interface by creating a bunch of widgets with the
MakeXXX() calls.  Next you layout the display by specifying the
relative positions of the widgets to each other.  Then you would get
any fonts or colors you may need, and finally you just enter the main
loop.

In libsx, your callback functions are where all the real work happens.
The program above has two callback functions, quit() and draw_stuff().
They are tied to events that happen in the interface.  When the user
clicks on the "Quit" button, your quit() function is called.  When the
drawing area gets resized or needs to be redrawn, your draw_stuff()
function gets called.

Usually the process of creating the interface would get separated into
a separate function that is easy to modify (instead of cluttering up
main).   However, the basic outline is the same as above.  The only
real difference with more complicated interfaces is that they usually
have a lot more calls to the MakeXXX() functions and they tend to make
use of the extra void pointer argument in the callback routines.

If you'd like more examples, take a look at the provided source code.
There are several reasonable examples of varying complexity that you
can take and modify as you like.  Each of the demos tries to
demonstrate a certain group of features, so take a look at each to
find the one that most closely matches what you want to do and start
hacking from there!


Have fun.

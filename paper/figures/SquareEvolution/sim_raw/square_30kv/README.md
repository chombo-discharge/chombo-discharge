where the time is in picoseconds.

The electric field is clamped to

|E| = [0, 4.5E7]

The electron density is clamped to

|n| = [0,1E20]

The view is simply a number:

view0:
	x = [0mm, 40mm]
	y = [0mm, 40mm]

view1:
	x = [4.6mm, 6.6mm]
	y = [4.2mm, 5.2mm]

view2:
	x = [21.9mm, 23.9mm]
	y = [4.3mm, 5.3mm]

view3:
	x = [21.85mm, 23.85mm]
	y = [4.3mm, 5.3mm]

view11: 
    x = [26mm, 30mm]
    y = [4mm, 6mm]

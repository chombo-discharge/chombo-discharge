  @brief Factory class for poisson solvers. Used to instantiate any FieldSolver-derived class. 
  @details This class is mostly used for easily making FieldSolvers of any type into a FieldSolver (i.e. casting to smart pointer), but also provides a factory
  method for generating any number of field solvers.
